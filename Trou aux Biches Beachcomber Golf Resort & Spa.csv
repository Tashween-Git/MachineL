Disappointed on all levels. No value at all for the money,I have never written a poor review till now| but this resort deserves one and then some. I was in the Maldives last Christmas (JA Manafaru) and I had expectations for a similar experience| as Trou aux Biches was a similar price (actually more slightly expensive). Both resorts are very expensive| btw. Unfortunately| we were disappointed on all fronts. So where do I start (in order of annoyance):1. Service is way sub par| due to poor personnel trainingWe spend 10 days so I have statistically valid sample – at every (every) meal (breakfast| lunch| dinner) I got a problem with my order – something forgotten| something| delayed| needing to repeat 5 times to 3 different people until you get a glass of wine| etc. It seems that people forget what you told them the second they turn their back. Most of them are nice and friendly but they are not trained well. There is are best practices and processes to remember and confirm an order| to speed up delivery of beverages at the expense of meals| etc. It has all been invented already. But not taught to the staff. Which is a pity as they have a training “Academy” next to the hotel!?I had at least two occasions when the staff tried to blame me for their mistakes| which is very rude. The fact that they did not understand or forgot is their problem. And again – there are methods for avoiding mistakes (like confirmations| repetitions| etc.) But in any case the customer is the king as he/she is playing the bill.2. Food was way below expectations for this price tag – again| I am not trying to be picky| but when I have paid 30|000 USD for 10 days bed and breakfast (excluding the meals) then I expect great food – like the on ewe got at the Maldives. That however was not the case ☹ Why – it beets me.3. VillaNot bad| but again| at Maldives we got beachfront villa| with private pool| private deck| private beach| etc. Here (for the same 30k USD for 10 days)| your “villa” is a part of a duplex of 4 apartments in a single building. No private anything.4. BeachThe beach is nice but very narrow. When the tide is high every noon| the water gets to the sunbeds. This would not have been a big problem if it wasn’t for the people who are constantly traversing the beach – both hotel guests and local people. So if you are expecting a secluded and serene beach – go elsewhere. It is a bit like manifestation here.So overall| I am most discontent because I paid a LOT of money and got way lower service and experience than I expected. I have been in many places around the world and this is one of the very few that have disappointed me on so many levels. And again| I didn’t have like one or tow annoying experiences – those happened over and over again. Just before I started writing this review the staff messed up (again!) my spa appointment – so I wasted my time waiting 30 minutes to learn they booked me for much later in contrast with what we have agreed.I will never consider this resort again| and I strongly recommend you avoid it. There are much nicer places with nicer and better personnel where you can have fun for 5 times less money.,Sofia| Bulgaria,05-01-18,Yes,1
Wonderful best resort in Mauritius ,Speechless!What a wonderful resort!!I had been to Mauritius a few times before| including in some of the other luxury hotels of the island| and this was by far my very best stay. Absolutely amazing hotel in all respects: outstanding facilities which cater for everyone - whether for someone who want peace and healthy / wellness retreat (the spa is state of the art| gym excellent with modern and well maintained comprehensive weight training machines + free weights + boxing| yoga and cardio options - I am a daily fitness bunny and even compared to a top London gym it was perfect for me!)| couples| families (kids clubs and nannies available).There are many different swimming pool and green areas which enable to maintain the peace for everyone| you never feel that the hotel is noisy or busy it is superbly designed!) ... fantastic service (including to cater to specific requirements). The food was excellent| especially at the seafood restaurant (The Deck) and the Italian one which both have outstanding chefs cooking super healthy and creative meals from top products. The seafront rooms with their private little pools are pure bliss to relax even further. The beach is perfect| with top smiling staff looking after the guests. It is a very long white pristine sandy beach| ultra clean and gorgeous| you can swim for hours throughout the length of the hotel at bath temperature. And the seaports facilities and staffs are equally awesome! The fabulous Fatima| the kindest precious soul with outstanding positive energy and charisma| is the assistant manager of the hotel and a true highlight of our stay: her commitment and willingness to make the most of a very enjoyable experience for our entire family (and all the other guests) should have a special reward!A real top 5 star hotels taking care of the well being of its guests. I will come back for sure and recommend it!!!Oh and icing on the cake: the hotel is optimally exposed to the sun| meaning you have it all day long and can enjoy breathtaking sunsets from the beach … Magic magic magic …,Malmo| Sweden,02-01-18,Yes,5
Wonderful tropical vacation,Good resort| good service (extra good in connection with my wife's birthday). Very well welcoming to the hotel. The food was good for being at a resort. The 3rd resort on Mauritsius for us and the Beachcomber concept feels professional. Just this resort may not be the best (Dinarobin)| but we recommend it anyway. You will not be disappointed.We particularly want to highlight Jeff Perrine at Oasis Bar as with his commitment and willingness to make the most of a very enjoyable experience for our entire family.,Malmo| Sweden,30-12-17,No,4
The best place on earth,Beautiful site with a very long sandy beach| very nice facilities| excellent food| smiling and friendly staff. A real 5 star hotels taking care of the well being of its guests. I’ll come back for sure,Brussels| Belgium,22-12-17,No,5
Holidays,Very Nice Beachcomber Hotel and we have a lovely stay for 3 night |very friendly staff |clean room and also good food | The Kids Club exceed our expectation | in general we were satisfied and the Art of Beautiful is well said ,Brussels| Belgium,22-12-17,No,5
Super nice hotel,Huge very nice resort| with lot of green areas. I had a junior suite| view on one of the swimming pools. Very big| very well equipped| clean| excellent service. Good wifi. The resort has a private beach| quite narrow| but nice. Lots of activities| 6 restaurants (I was on HB) ... all this requires some planning (you normally do not find place for the most requested activities nor for the restaurants| for the same day)| but it is doable without any stress.,Brussels| Belgium,21-12-17,No,5
Feedback on my stay at Trou Aux Biches Golf Resort and Spa,What I liked the most was the friendliness of the staff. The overall service experience was very satisfactory due to them. Special mention for Mahiya Restaurant where the food was out of this world. Buffet and breakdast nedd to be revisited...However| good sleep in the rooms. ,Kuusisto,17-12-17,No,3
Room for improvement,Good hotel but poor quality of food and not enough variety at the L'Oasis buffet. Very disappointing . Very spacious room and well equipped. Overall we had a nice stay but food quality should be improved ,Kuusisto,17-12-17,Yes,3
Super Nice Hotel,This reminds me about paradise on earth. Absolutely lovely hotel. We had 3 bedroom villa for 6 persons. I can honestly recommend this to any demanding traveler. Hotel has seven different restaurants. You'll never need to eat same food twice. Only major minus goes to live birds| which will sit on your breakfast table| if you don't pay attention. Other smaller minus goes to slow service in the restaurants. If if you are super hungry| get prepared to wait min 30min before you'll get your order.,Kuusisto,17-12-17,Yes,5
Magnificent Resort,One of my favourite Beachcomber Resorts and now with the new Mont Choisy golf course 3km down the road| this place has become even MORE attractive for me! The new course by Peter Matkovich is magnificent!,Durban| South Africa,16-12-17,Yes,5
honeymoon,everything is awesome. i had so happy days. foods| traver| staffs and activity. when you visit to mourititus i will recommend here. actually i will visit again. and i naver forgot coffee at the resort. ,Triolet,12-12-17,Yes,5
Awesome,was a great ambiance fantastic hotel fantastic people more importantly the have instill the mauritian culture in their people and smile all the way precise careful hotel with a great attitude that makes you happy.,Johannesburg| Gauteng| South Africa,11-12-17,Yes,5
Fantastic stay,We stayed 16 days in November and had a fabulous time. Great setting| atmosphere and staff. Delicious food and we really made the most of the water sports at The Boat House. The dive center is excellent. ,Johannesburg| Gauteng| South Africa,09-12-17,Yes,5
One of the most romantic hotels in Mauritius,Outstanding hotel and outstanding staff in a beautiful location that photos cannot do justice too. Our beach facing room was literally 50 feet from the beach and the food was perfect throughout the entire resort.We highly recommend this hotel to couples looking for a romantic getaway and time to themselves.,Johannesburg| Gauteng| South Africa,08-12-17,Yes,5
A little bit of paradise,This magnificent hotel is a bit of paradise. On a group holiday| as part of an award for my wife| and 9 other couples - the hotel went out of its way to accommodate us. Spent 6 nights here. The large spacious rooms open up to your own patio and private pool over looking evergreen palm trees and the tropical| and radiant hues of blue ocean. The beach is magnificent - with plenty of activities at the hotel. This hotel boasts five gourmet restaurants each with its unique style and flavour an all ocean facing. The executive assistant Ms Fathima| was always so pleasant and well posied - knowing all of her guest by name making us feel so very welcomed. This resort is luxurious and a dream resort to stay at. The grandeur of this paradise is breathtaking.,Johannesburg| Gauteng| South Africa,08-12-17,Yes,5
Good quailty,Solid 5 Star quality on a nice beach. Good service| friendly atmosphere| good water and sporting facilities. The only thing which was irritating was that the hotel accepted reserving Beach chairs in the early morning| so same we know from mass 2-3star tourism at the mediterrenian ,Zurich| Switzerland,07-12-17,Yes,5
A super hotel,We were given a very good welcome and escorted to our rooms. Most of the rooms are two storey in a horse shoe shape around a pool| six horseshoes and six pools and a huge central pool near the restaurants and reception. The rooms were huge and tastefully decorated| a very spacious balcony| large bathroom with plenty of soft towels and adequate toiletries. A super buffet restaurant with an amazing choice of food and separate cooking stations. Four separate a LA carte restaurants available also. Throughout the hotel the staff were very attentive and polite. Overall an amazing experience.,Doncaster| United Kingdom,04-12-17,Yes,5
Beautiful location| great service,We stayed for four nights at the Beachcomber TAB. The hotel grounds are stunning and our room was huge.Service was great from all staff and everything was helpful.Breakfast was awesome| the quality of the products was very good (my judging panel: eggs| pancakes/waffles/crepes| viennoiseries (pain au chocolat| croissant etc)| juice). There was also non-alcoholic champagne for breakfast| which is a great start of the day!,London| United Kingdom,01-12-17,Yes,5
Recovery of Mobile Phone,This is a slightly off-the-wall review| as we didn't stay at the Trou aux Biches Beachcomber Resort & Spa - however| the dedication and efficiency of the staff made a major contribution to our holiday. I rather foolishly left my mobile phone on a bench overlooking the beach and bordering the hotel - an hour or so later (having realised my loss)| I called my phone more in vain hope than expectation| only for it to be answered by security at the Beachcomber| where one of the hotel staff had taken the phone. Honest| helpful and appreciative of the disruption and diminution of an enjoyable holiday that the loss of a phone can cause| I send my unreserved thanks to the staff of the Beachcomber.,London| United Kingdom,01-12-17,Yes,5
Honeymoon Nov 2017,We had an amazing time on our honeymoon and stayed in a beach front suite with pool. We have absolutely no complaints and were extremely well looked after by Leckraj and his teams in the Mahiya and Blue Ginger restaurants. We didn’t want to come home and would love to return one day. ,Triolet,26-11-17,Yes,5
It was not what I expected,For that kind of money| there are much better possibilities. First of all| there is nothing to do at nights after dinner. No entertainment and the ones they did were very poor quality. Hotel has alot of restaurants but you need to make reservations 2-3 days in advance. And the main restaurant's food variety is very poor also especially for breakfast.,Triolet,22-11-17,Yes,3
Very beautiful and good value resort,We stayed at three different properties during our two weeks vactions on Mauritus and this resort was clearly the best value (especially the fair pricing of drinks). Resort maintenance and sport equipment is up-to-date and staff is friendly and helpful. Foods quality and diversity was very good! Go for it.,Mumbai,22-11-17,Yes,5
Lovely resort !!!,Me and my wife spent one week in this beautiful resort. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Our room and all resort was perfectly clean. Transfer from Airport to hotel takes about one hour. During checkin you will receive welcome drink with a fruit. We really enjoyed L'Oasis buffet restaurant with big selection of local and continental food. In case your flight back home is in the evening you can checkout from your room and enjoy rest of your day in resort with all benefits then you will receive access to the single room to change clothes and you can leave resort late evening| which is very helpful.I can just reccomend this resort for your stay in Mauritius.,Mumbai,16-11-17,Yes,5
Great stay at Trou aux Biches!,I enjoyed a great stay with my husband and my two year old son. We booked a junior suite with a private swimming pool. My son was provided with all the amenities (bath tub| baby cot| bottle sterilizer/warmer| toilet seat etc..) to provide us parents| a stress free weekend. The food at the Thai restaurant was simply amazing and the Spa facilities is also highly commendable for those looking for a relaxation moment. I would highly recommend anyone planning for holidays in Mauritius to choose Trou-aux-Biches Beachcomber hotel.,Mumbai,14-11-17,Yes,5
Great beach,Lovely rooms - a bit dark but then i guess that's a resort for you.Good food - great service staffThe breakfast is a lovely spread and the evenings have theme dinners in the coffee shopsAsk for a room in crescent 1 or 2,Mumbai,08-11-17,Yes,5
Fabulous resort. Longer breakfast times advisable.,Trou aux Biches is a fantastic resort| on a fabulous beach| on a wonderful Island.There are 4 things that stand out in this resort:1/ locationThis resort is located at the North West side of the Island. This means 2 wins:- the norther part is the sunniest part of the country. This is especially relevant if you are looking for a short stay. (2-3 days of consecutive rainfall and no sunshine are very common in this part of the world)- the western part of the country is shielded from the dominant winds which are mostly from a south eastern direction. For those who have been to the Maldives| this is the part of the island where the water is almost still as a lake. An ideal environment for coral to grow in shallow waters.The eastern part on the contrary has a fantastic lagoon which stretches from north to south. On the Western side there are fewer lagoons| and they are smaller and equally beautiful. It means that you can almost snorkel all the way up from the beach to the reef.2/ the tropical garden & beachThe garden is fantastic fusion between natural and cultivated vegetation. It’s a real birds paradise. If you mind the sound of birds in the morning| ask the reception for a location with lesser bird population. The bungalows are all orientated towards each other and every area has it’s own swimming pool. So no towel fights in the morning. Dito for the beach.Like all beaches in Mauritius| Trou auw biches is a public beach but with private seafront beds. (See foto)3/ foodBefore mauritius became an English colony| it belonged to France. That heritage and love for fine dining is cultivated in every single restaurant. As a half board guest| you can dine in the a la carte restaurants. Some dishes require a supplement.4/ friendliness of staffAlthough this is not a feature of this resort but part of the Mauritian DNA. Fantastic people. (Hard not to be if you’re living in one of the most beautiful Islands in the world)There is only one « to be improved »| but it’s an important one. Breakfast stops at 10 am. Room service is provided until 10:30| comes at a suppliment and you have to miss out on the freshness of a buffet breakfast. Although this is a common practice in the area (eg Maldives) this is far below worldwide standards. Breakfast should be served until 11:00am. Room service untill noon. The thing that annoys the most is that 9:30 is rush hour. So you might have to line up and wait for 5 to 10 minutes. The latter is totally unacceptable for a resort of this category.,Sichuan| China,08-11-17,Yes,5
Impressed by staff !,My business partner and me visited several hotels last month all over Mauritius| When we just reached Trou aux biches actuallty wasn't a nice experience| the main gate took too much time to grant access for us| and porters (or concierge staff ) didn't help us to open the car door| even they looked at us inside the car twice but just turned back face talking with each other. But my impression to this hotel becomes EXCELLENT because of the staff named Celine from Front Office(Sorry not sure whether the spelling is correct) . She took hotel map and business card to us| also explained room categories and hotel facilities very very in detail as if we are check-in guests. Later on Celine showed us around this beautiful resort by buggy. Fortunately me and my business partner got chances to visit at least 3 rooms from different categories. Trou aux Biches is the most wonderful resort I have visited in Mauritius!At end of the visit Celine gave us a sales kit which we can get more information about this lovely resort. Thank you Celine for your warm welcoming and all you did for us!Regards|Snow & Wenpeng from China,Sichuan| China,05-11-17,Yes,5
Shame,Very poor food options and the kids likened it to school dinners!! Many fabulous features and rooms were incredible but the food was a real let down and we were disturbed by the way the water sports staff mistreated the reef. The hotel claims to be green and to take steps to protect the reef but we saw no evidence| instead we saw the staff thoroughly mistreat it. How can you drop an anchor directly on a reef in this day and age?,London| United Kingdom,05-11-17,Yes,2
Luxury service in paradise,Myself| my husband and 3 year old son stayed with my Mum| Mother-in-law and aunt in a 3 bed villa and had an amazing stay. This was our luxury holiday for the year to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday earlier in the month. My son has allergies and is essentially vegan and the rest of our group are pure vegetarian. We were well catered for and my son was especially pleased to have lemon sorbet for his dessert every evening!Jay at L'Oasis was incredibly friendly and ensured we were all well fed at breakfast. The team were able to supply eggless croissants which made the mums very happy!Prateema came to discuss our food arrangements and made great suggestions| including having a chef cook in-house for us| where we had amazing Mauritian cuisine.Sharmila| our butler| was fantastic and ensured that our villa was comfortable and we had whatever we neededThe restaurants all had lovely food. A big thanks to the team at Blue Ginger Thai for catering to our requests and making delicious meals on the 2 occasions we visited. It was the best Thai we've had.The grounds of the hotel were beautifully kept and our villa was extremely spacious. My son loved going swimming in the pool| but equally loved going to the gorgeous beach to swim and play there| too.My son also enjoyed the Kids Club. The staff were very friendly and the facilities and activities were very good.The staff and service were fantastic. My son got a splinter in his foot from a mat in our bedroom. As we were unable to remove it| we called for assistance. Lata arrived within less than 5 minutes| had a lovely manner with my son and out him at ease. She also called a colleague to remove the mat from our room| and returned on our last day to check my son was ok.We had a memorable holiday which was made more memorable by the beautiful hotel and grounds and the wonderful staff that we encountered. We will certainly visit again,Somerset West| South Africa,03-11-17,Yes,5
WE at TAB Golf Resort and Spa from a Mauritian family,We had an excellent Week End. We Enjoyed the food and the boat house a lot. We also enjoyed the family suite and its separate swimming pool.We had a nice surprise for diner| It was our wedding anniversary & we have been privileged guest.,Somerset West| South Africa,30-10-17,Yes,4
Review of Trou Aux Biches Golf Resort and Spa,We are a family of two adults and one 5 year child who visited the resort october 2017. The resort is excellent by all means. 10 out of 10 on the following; service| facilities| location| beach| food| house keeping| internet| sports centre| tennis courts| pools.We had a beach front suite with pool. This was an absolute astonishing experience. Highly recommended to both families| honymooners and other couples ,Somerset West| South Africa,28-10-17,Yes,5
10 star luxury in a tropical paradise,I'm not sure where to begin reviewing this outstanding resort because it is absolutely stunning in so many ways. The warmth of the staff is my most vivid memory and there were so many members of the enormous team who made us feel so welcome and special. During our stay the hotel was almost full and we were fortunate to be there for the Diwali celebrations which involved a huge amount of work. All those lights and décor and amazing buffet without the assistance of a magic wand were amazing.Our holiday started rather dramatically in the early hours when my husband was in trouble with excruciating back pain. Abhishek who welcomed us on arrival as he was on night duty came to his rescue and in no time at all the doctor appeared and he was taken to a clinic in Port Louis by ambulance. I was kept informed by Fatima and Sarah on a regular basis which was very comforting and after his discharge the following day everywhere we went the staff enquired how he was feeling. I was introduced to Nicolas (King of Maintenance) by Sarah when I asked if it would be possible to have a board put under the mattress. In no time at all there was a knock on the door of our room and it was sorted! Walking around the glorious surroundings on a daily basis I was aware of so much activity keeping the gardens/rooms/beach/pools in pristine condition. There are many unseen members of staff who help with the running of such a classy establishment and they are much appreciatedWe have been to Trou aux Biches on three occasions and each time it gets better and better. The staff| the beach| the crystal clear ocean| the food| the tours and boat rides on offer| I could go on forever .... but if you want to have an out of this world experience on a beautiful island| please book now!,Somerset West| South Africa,27-10-17,Yes,5
Trou aux Biche,Our third visit and second one to the new development. Wonderful: Location: Staff: Ambience: Beach: Restaurants: Accommodation:Anyone who fails to enjoy TAB must have a problem as it is amongst the best I have visited. However| some folk have a tendency to be aggressive and rude to staff which does not help them and their stay. I have personally seen it. Charm and friendliness can go a long way.,Somerset West| South Africa,27-10-17,Yes,5
Family holiday ,Great value for money| we stayed in senior suite beach view. Unmatchable location with excellent view from beach front suite. Mahiya Indian restaurant have excellent staff very welcoming and friendly and obviously food is best. ,Hertfordshire,27-10-17,Yes,5
Wonderful,Firstly| the hotel was fully booked but it never felt busy which was amazing. We had a Tropical junior suite which was a great size with the bonus of an outdoor shower (there is an indoor shower too| but we didn't use it!) The rooms are kept spotless| the bed was huge and very comfortable.Each set of suites has its own pool| the pool was large| clean and rarely had more than 2 other people there. Heaven.The food was largely faultless| the buffet was always fresh and really tasty| and Divya the maitre'd was fabulous. She always had a smile on her face and made sure you were happy. That girl deserves a promotion!Our favourite restaurants were Mahiya (Indian) and La Caravelle (International).We also had a couples massage at the spa which was heavenly| you get to enjoy the spa facilities and private pool for the whole day if you wish (when you have a treatment) and it was lovely. Khan did my husbands massage and within 5 minutes said it was the best he had ever had. He used reflexology techniques which really loosened and relaxed my husband.We would also recommend taking a taxi into Port Louis and heading into the markets. It is an attack on every sense and the smell of coriander will not leave me. We also had a locals lunch in the market| roti with sauce wrap. Top Tip: join the longest queue in the food hall and ask for the same as the locals are having| you won't be disappointed.,Hertfordshire,26-10-17,Yes,5
Great location shame about the staff,The location of this hotel was perfect. A 15min bus ride took us to bustling Grand Baie. A short walk along the beach took us to the village of Trou aux Biches with its numerous restaurants| shops and travel agents. All of this on the most beautiful soft sandy beach. The hotel was stunning with water features. Our villa was spacious with a large balcony overlooking a pool and the largest bathroom I have ever seen.Unfortunately the hotel is let down by its staff. There is no concierge. When we asked one of the staff where the bus stop was we were told to get a taxi| but we wanted to experience the local transport. When we asked for information about points of interest etc we were directed to a lady sitting at a desk who was a rep for a travel company and wanted to charge us exorbitant amounts for organized coach trips.All the restaurants except the buffet have to be reserved through the food and beverage desk where they seem to put their rudest members of staff.We were celebrating our 50th anniversary while we were there and wanted to organise something special.but got no help whatsoever. We then requested a special table at one of the restaurants for the day a week in advance and were told we could put our names down but if there was a wedding they would have priority. Fair enough| but when we checked the day before the event were told there was no wedding but the table had been reserved by someone else. we ended up organising our own celebration at another restaurant outside the hotel.I loved Trou aux Biches but will not be returning to this hotel.,Adelaide| Australia,25-10-17,Yes,4
A beautiful honeymoon,We stayed for 4 nights in a junior suite which was beautiful. The beach was fantastic and overall the resort was great. The perfect way to relax and end our honeymoon having come from safari in South Africa.,Sydney| New South Wales| Australia,25-10-17,Yes,5
Great Honeymoon Destination,Perfect in all ways. Food was excellent| staff were friendly and accommodating| loads of activities if you like but equally quiet if you want to relax. Swimming with dolphins was a great added bonus..,Nairobi| Kenya,23-10-17,Yes,5
Memory making holiday,We had a fabulous stay at the Trou aux Biches resort. We stayed in a private villa with outside bath & shower & own pool! We were looked after in a friendly but professional way by Chipper; he was fabulous| we were all very fond of him by the end of our stay. The food in the resort was good but we especially enjoyed eating the Mauritian cuisine & BBQ cooked by Chipper in our own villa. We booked a trip through the hotel to go out into the bay and had the chance of a life time to swim with dolphins! The kids loved this| even the youngest my little 5 year old hopped in with her vest & mask. The water sports at the hotel were great & readily available as were vests| flippers & masks. It was very expensive though to eat and drink anything at the hotel which was outside of your package. A lovely luxurious hotel with friendly staff that we would definitely visit again if we were to return to Mauritius. ,Nairobi| Kenya,21-10-17,Yes,5
Simply perfect,Gorgeous everything: location| rooms (second shower outside under the stars...)| food (a chunk of raw tuna which chefs thinly sliced| wow); divine pools| proximity to the beach (right on it) and the gardens!!!!!! People who love palms| stay there to walk the alley of miniature dates or clumps of red Royal palms. Maintained immaculately. Transportation within hotel in golf cars. We had 5 a.m.departure - they served great breakfast just for two of us. All absolutely perfect. ,Nairobi| Kenya,20-10-17,Yes,5
The perfect stay,Fab all round experience. Great for children with the kids club having good activities and kids care. Food choice outstanding with L’oasis and Indian restaurant being highlights. Staff friendly and responsive. Great value for money. Loved it.,London| United Kingdom,19-10-17,Yes,5
The hotel was lovely in relation to location| facilities and rooms but it was so expensive to eat it left a bitter taste,The hotel was lovely in relation to location| facilities and rooms but it was so expensive to eat it left a bitter taste.The staff were often almost rude when it came to asking for anything that was even slightly out of he norm. Everything was quite regimented in terms of times etc.Beautiful hotel. Immorally expensive,Triolet,17-10-17,Yes,3
A daydream,Situated on the west coast of Mauritius| the best one during the southern winter| it has everything a big one has : space| extended beach| a good selection of restaurants| beautiful gardens| wonderful spa| quality of service| luxurious suites with large bathroom and lovely amenities| choice of sport activities| several pools...,Auckland| New Zealand,16-10-17,Yes,5
16 days in paradise,Mauritius is a dream destination| no nasty animals and no mosquitos| at least none who wanted to eat me and I am usually their first stop. For us the Beachcomber Trou aux Biches is the best resort. We have visited a lot of excellent resorts around the world but Trou aux Biches tops all of them by miles. The staff is super friendly and are going out of their way to make your holiday a fabulous experience.The resort is huge and all the accommodations are spread throughout the resort with heaps of privacy. Even if the resort is full you never feel if. No need to reserve lounger there are plenty of them. 7 normal sized pools and one gigantic one| and the sea including a wonderful sandy beach.I travelled with my parents and we had booked a two bedroom villa. Three years ago we had the pleasure to get an upgrade and this time we did not want to miss out on the ultimate privacy. The villas have a little private garden with pool and you have the ultimate pleasure of your own Butler. Bo| our butler looked after us extremely well and went the extra mile. Breakfast is served for you in your garden| what a treat. For dinner you have the choice between 6 different restaurants and different they all are. The buffet restaurant serves different specialities every day| often with a country theme like e.g. India| or China. These themes repeat each week| however don’t expect the same food. If you have a sweet tooth then you are in heaven here. You have never seen such a variety. The other restaurants are al la carte. Italian| Indian| Thai| French| Mediterranean.This time we visited the spa for the first time and what can I say it is tranquility pure. Any worries will fall off instantly by just walking into the place. Have a treatment and you can use the facilities all day| steam room| another huge swimming pool.Well I mentioned the helpful staff already: Bo our butler| Jeet who did the turning down duties and Fatima who has become a friend. She will help with anything. I lost my crown| luckily did not swallow it| during dinner and by lunch time the next day she had organised a visit to the dentist and all was good again. You feel like part of the family. I hope my parents keep healthy and we can come back next year. Thank you,Auckland| New Zealand,15-10-17,Yes,5
Extremely friendly and helpful staff| gorgeous hotel and location!,This was my second stay| marking birthday celebrations| and it exceeded my already high expectations! The restaurant manager (Anwar) organised a special dinner table| with rose petals| and even arranged for a birthday cake and sparkling drink for all 4 of us! Staff were brilliant| friendly and very attentive throughout our stay. Heated pools in every crescent meant no over-crowding and very quiet and relaxing time by the pool. Sunsets on the beach are the best. Booking was made directly through the hotel| which meant a more personalised service.,Munich| Germany,12-10-17,Yes,5
Great experience| nice resort| beautiful beach,Very nice resort| the great suite we had. Beach is very nice| ocean with beautiful different blue shades. Staff very helpful. Only one thing in the bathroom the Marmor tiles in the shower were already broken and did look a bit filthy. Allover I would recommend it though.,Munich| Germany,11-10-17,Yes,5
Honeymoon,By far an amazing place to stay| the staff| food| rooms. Not one thing I can fault. It’s a must visit. Most water activities are free. The food at the buffet restaurant is superb. There are also Al Le Carte restaurants. Amazing spa facilities. The list is endless ,Johannesburg,11-10-17,Yes,5
An expansive resort| first class facilities,Based on the North West part of Mauritius| good weather can be expected at this time of the year (early October) . We were not disappointed. The resort is large| the accommodation is well spaced and sufficient choice of restaurants ensures enjoyable dining experiences. Unfortunately| no golf course - despite being advertised as a golf resort. Beaches are clean. Staff are pleasant and friendly. Close to Grand Bay| so a daily outing is recommended,Johannesburg,11-10-17,Yes,5
An expansive resort | fantastic location,Trou Biches is a large resort with plenty of space between units| allowing for a relaxing and pleasant holiday. Beaches are clean| staff efficient and service good. The gym is well worth using with good equipment Dinner choices were good but breakfast menu (a buffet) was somewhat limited and repetitive. No golf course though - even though advertised as a golf resort ,Johannesburg| South Africa,09-10-17,Yes,5
Repeat performance - Revisited,I reviewed Trou aux Biches in 2014 after our 4th visit. We have returned every year since then. We even stay in the same room every time! overall this must be one of the most magnificent properties on Mauritius with one of the very best beaches. It caters for the whole family and via the 6 restaurants on the property cater for every taste in food. The Spa is excellent and the facilities for our 14 year old son fantastic. The entertainment in the evenings were not on the same standard as previous years and the setting of tables in the main restaurant| both at breakfast and dinner was also not on par with previous years. We love Trou aux Biches and will certainly return next year however| in an environment where there is stiff competition taking care of the small things becomes very important.,Johannesburg| South Africa,09-10-17,Yes,5
Absolutely amazing !,If you are looking for a perfect holiday with every single bit of it *taken care* then this is the place. The villa service is perhaps the best I have seen In the world. The timeliness | care| clock work perfection and yet warm caring and personalised. Our villa butler Aureale has to be the best omelette maker in the world : So kind caring and with robotic powers to conjure anything from a perfect in villa bbq to a delicious green island rum cocktail .Thank you for the happiest memories. Holidays are meant to be just this. We will be back soon ,Triolet,08-10-17,Yes,5

best value to money,excellent service by all employees:they are friendly| try the best to fulfill requests.excellent facilities: rooms are clean well air conditioned| with plenty of placerestaurants: there are 5 different cuisines with variety of offers.water sport facilities: Hobby-cats| wind surfing| pedal boats| sap's kayaksInternal transportation with club cars make the vacation easy and memorable. ,Triolet,05-10-17,No,5

Relaxing Vacation in Paradise,A wonderful hotel area| small villas are located in a quite and relaxing tropical garden atmosphere. The booked tropical suite was spacious| clean and in good condition. The very friendly and helpful hotel staff makes the real difference. We enjoyed the variety of several good restaurants and dining events | which gave us a plenty of choice. Our absolute favorites are the smaller Indian and Thai restaurant| both delivering excellent food and dedicated service.,Feldkirchen| Germany,03-10-17,No,5

Heaven on Earth,We really enjoyed our one week stay here. Every day had something new and amazing. Pictures don’t do justice to this little paradise. The food was amazing and you would never leave a meal unsatisfied. Special mention and praise has to go out to the staff of this beautiful resort| namely Fatima| Anwar| Ravi| Lekraj| Dave| Jay| Steve| Karishma| Divya| Gerald| Nitin| Unaut and Ricardo who went out of their way to make our stay extra special. Impeccable service that we have not seen anywhere else| very professional and pleasant atmosphere! Any request was greeted with a smile and satisfied immediately. PS...One of the highlights has to be the amazing sunsets over the Indian Ocean| mesmerizing...This was by far| the best vacation we have ever had. Thank you Trou Aux Biches - Beachcomber for a magical time. We will definitely be returning one day...Ronesh & Karishma,Johannesburg| South Africa,01-10-17,Yes,5
Trou aux Biches is not 5 star hotel,The attention and services of hotel is really poor| it is not a five star hotel. The room and installations are good| it is not the better location in Mauritius but it is not bad.We have a bad expirience with cleanliness| we bought gifts and all bags were opned in our room.,Community of Madrid| Spain,30-09-17,Yes,2
Excellent hotel in the North of Mauritius,Very large resort 350 rooms spread over 30ha of beachfront. What we liked.....hmmmm....everything. The grounds are flawless| staff very well trained| good processes for every guest need. The rooms are VERY large and very well appointed. The bathroom that we had was almost 40 square metres.....just the bathroom. Everything works and privacy is a priority.There are several restaurants that require booking but the buffet is very good....we actually liked it better that the a la carte.Thoroughly recommended.....a very good Beachcomber resort.( as opposed to Shandrani that is a desaster area to be avoided at all costs),Devonport| Tasmania| Australia,30-09-17,Yes,5
Mesmerising,"First time to Beachcomber resort and definitely not the last.We were amazed by the kindness of the staff and the service just ""wow"". No need to go anywhere else| you have everything inside.Special thanks to Jonathan and the kiddies club team| Aurelie| Joanny| Alicia| Laury and Maiva. My kids are still talking about you guys| keep it up!!!We are absolutely coming back next year.",Devon| United Kingdom,29-09-17,Yes,5
Amazing stay!,This is an amazing hotel where staff go that extra mile. We arrived in August with our son felling poorly from being travel sick on the long flight. The manager was lovely and welcoming. We were made to feel comfortable and less stressed immediately. There is a local drink called Citronella on arrival made with local herbs supposed to settle the stomach and it worked on our son's poorly tummy! Check in was very chilled out and relaxing. Our room was available immediately and they adapted the normal welcoming due to our tired son.The meals were brilliant in restaurant. The Indian restaurant Mahiya was brilliant and we returned as we enjoyed the menu. We enjoyed the music from Rajesh and kind of him to give our children music lessons. The Thai| Blue Ginger| was good and service great. The Italian| Il Corallo had good food again but slow service. They got our order incorrect. We met another 2couples that had the similar experience. They seemed short staff and very busy. The buffet was great and our kids aged 9 and 12 tried food that they would not normally try and enjoyed. The service at buffet dinner and breakfast was attentive.The pool food menu was limited| again service great.Pool was very clean.Kids club was relaxed and kids could turn up when wanted. They loved the water skiing lessons and paddle boats sessions. Spa treatments were lovely and staff professional.Our Family Room was very comfortable- excellent beds and spacious- a walk to the main pool as resort spread out but excellent views of the beach so did not mind. The views of the sunset were spectacular- great photos taken.The beach is local but entrance to hotel pool well guarded.The Island is amazing and we look forward to returning to Mauritius. It is differnet to Maldives. Lots to do with kids- weather is tropical so expect short rain showers. Casela was great fun- highly recommend zip wiring from 70 metres high with kids. Very safe. Inland lots to do as well as lots of water sports.We would like to thank Rajesh our pool attendant for making our stay special- he went that extra mile for us| Nitesh and Nasser our driver from Mauritico. This hotel is well sheltered from the trade winds being on the North West coast so agin another reason to book. Thank you Trou aux Biche for giving us a memorable holiday. We know we shall return again.,Warwick| United Kingdom,26-09-17,Yes,5
Dream come true 💍,One month ago i married the love of my life at the beach of this magical hotel. The people in Mauritius are the kindest i've ever met. Miss it already so much! If you want to visit Mauritius you have to book this beautiful hotel| it has the best service| cuisine and staff. I will come back to this 10⭐️ hotel ❤,Grimsby England,26-09-17,Yes,5
Not the honeymoon we had hoped for...,"Having just returned from our honeymoon at Trou Aux Biches I feel it's the best time to review this hotel. After a long trip via a change in Dubai the journey in from the airport leaves a lot to be desired but soon as you pass the security gates it makes it worth while visiting. The grounds are immaculate and it feels a different world once inside to what's outside the resort!Our room the senior suite is set on the top floor near the beach| many palm trees however block a direct view of the ocean which is a shame! The room is enormous with a lovely outdoor shower and private balcony area with good size plunge pool below if just a little cold! We stayed half board with honeymoon package| breakfast at L'Oasis was plentiful and the meals at the restaurants of a very high standard. We ate at each restaurant and found La Caravelle| Le Deck and Ill Corallo the best to use. You have to book ahead though as they get busy and this is where the problems unfortunately begin. 4 nights out of the 10 we were told as we entered each restaurant that they had no reservation even though we had a written meal planner from the hotel with each reservation clearly written on! This is purely unacceptable to happen as often as it did and we got told at the Indian on our last night that all the tables were full even though we had a timed booking and had to wait at the bar until one was available 45 mins later| this meant we missed the evenings entertainment and had a very late dinner on the last night of our honeymoon! You are however given a complimentary drink whilst waiting but it does show a clear lack of communication which you don't expect at a 5* hotel. Another thing I would like to mention is the dress code at Trou Aux Biches doesn't appear to be followed through either as I saw many men on evenings wearing Jeans| round neck T.Shirts and even flip flops! In my opinion if you are requesting a dress code the staff must enforce this as guests like myself bought items i wouldn't necessarily buy! The beach is lovely and the water crystal clear ideal for swimming and using the water sport facilities. I found the workers at the boathouse not overly helpful. I personally had never used a paddle board before and did say this at the time but I was just put in the water and left to fathom it out for myself which I found disappointing! The hawkers on the beach are such a nuisance| you just get constantly bothered all day long with the ""junk"" they sell to a point we avoided laying on what is a lovely beach! I am mentioning this now as on check out the gentleman on the desk just presented the bill and once we paid took the money and key card and walked off. We paid a lot of money for this honeymoon and we were left a little underwhelmed as we left...It should be a 5* resort as the layout and facilities are faultless but the general service does leave a lot to be desired at times and can't see ourselves returning to Mauritius!",Grimsby England,24-09-17,Yes,4
Best Hotel on Mauritius,Best Hotel on Mauritius.Delicious Food| beautiful rooms and a paradisiacal site.Top offer for free| for example Waterski| Stand-up paddle| Canoe| ......The service ist very friendly and watchful all the time.You have to go to this beautiful Hotel.,Zurich| Switzerland,23-09-17,Yes,5
Unforgettable Honeymoon,Trou aux Beach beachcomber has high quality. From the facilities to the staff| everything was great. There are 6 restaurants| the only one we thaught wasn't that great| Il Corallo - The Italian. From the others| Oasis is the buffet restaurant. The Thai restaurant and the Indian have a specific menu everyday. La Caravelle and Le Deck are a La Carte and serve lunch and dinner with different menu. Our favorite was Le Deck| outstanding staff!!! Beach is great and the SUNSET is one of the most unforgettable things that we all should have the opportunity to witness! ,London| United Kingdom,23-09-17,Yes,5
Great holiday,We have just returned from tru aux biches after two weeks relaxing in this beautiful resort. Rooms amazing| service amazing|location out of this world. We tried all of the restaurants which gave excellent service although la caravel was our favourite. We did find that lunches were very expensive but a ten minute walk along the beach gave us some very cheap local food. Staff were attentive and professional. Hawkers on the beach could be a little annoying but most took no for an answer without any fuss. Lots of security visible at the resort which was reassuring. All in all a fabulous holiday even with the very long flights to get there| was well worth it.,London| United Kingdom,23-09-17,Yes,5
Very Relaxing Holiday,I stayed at this hotel with my wife and three children's. We had a family suite nearer to the beach. The room had a balcony which had a view of the pool. The rooms and batch rooms were very clean and the house keeping always kept everything toped up in the morning and evening. The hotel is located on Trou aux beach which is one the best beach in Mauritius. The choice of food at the buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner was good . I would definitely recommend a visit to the Indian restaurant which was really good. All staff were always smiling and very helpful in particular Anwar at the buffet restaurant was always going extra miles to assist. We enjoyed the water sports offered by the hotel. I would definitely return to this hotel in future.,London| United Kingdom,21-09-17,Yes,5
Amazing Hotel,As many have commented this is an excellent hotel with friendly staff| good food| excellent beach| fun water sports and good accommodation.What sets this hotel apart from many others are the grounds. They are immaculate and give the whole hotel real sense of being in a tropical oasis.If I have one criticism is the hotel needs to be stricter with the beach sellers. Whilst they are polite and well mannered being asked 15-20 times a day if your are interested in a massage| catamaran trip or bracelet gets tedious. That said I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.Also if you have time try the undersea walking in Grand Bay about 15 minutes by taxi. It was great fun especially if you are a group. Ladies you don't even smudge your makeup or get your hair wet.,London| United Kingdom,18-09-17,Yes,5
Great holiday,We stayed in the Trou aux Biches Beachcomber hotel 10 days and we were very satisfied with room ( senior beach suite)| service| food| activities etc. Food was very good and tasty. We will definitely return again.,Bratislava| Slovakia,17-09-17,No,5
Best hotel| value and location In Mauritius,I highly recommend trou aux biches resort. we stayed in the family suite with 2 kids and it really is the perfect accommodation. I researched on the internet for weeks about which hotel to stay in but there is no doubt that this was the best choice.The resort is extremely well run and the service was exceptional. All the staff really deserve the greatest praise and they can be proud of their achievements.,Cape Town| South Africa,17-09-17,No,5
Almost a 5 star. Second hotel on a Saga tour of this island,So pleased we were able to visit this beautiful resort as our hotel we were going to was closed for refurbishment . It was an outstanding hotel set in the most beautiful grounds of shrubs| plants and lots of palms and other trees. Plenty of birds to admire. The beach was fabulous and it always had plenty of chairs to sit on. The pool was lovely to. The rooms were huge but the lighting in the room was very dark. The bathroom was better. We enjoyed the food but this is why we did not give it the 5 star rating. We ate at all the a la carte restaurants. The Indian was very disappointing. No flavours or heat in the dishes even though we said we liked a hot dish. The Italian was also not as good as we hoped .we went to the lunch time buffet once which really wasn't that good. We had salad but there was no cold meats|fish or cheeses to go with it. You really need to go on the all inclusive package as the food and drinks soon add up |thankfully we were. We were at breakfast for about 7.40. First day bacon wasn't cooked and although we had our eggs were told bacon would be another 10 minutes. Plus 3 mornings while we were eating we were asked to stand up so they could put the cushions on the chairs. Small things but they shouldn't happen. Fatima was very nice and made sure we were enjoying our stay. Would recommend this hotel to our friends,Colchester| United Kingdom,17-09-17,No,4
Nice hotel located in a nice beach.,Nice hotel located in a nice beach. My fourth time in this hotelHas six different type of exelent restaurats. Lot of different sport activities - tennis and watter sports... aldo fishing oportunities.,turku,17-09-17,No,5

Fatima and her team were awesome| particularly Carene who looked after us all.They went above and beyond our expectations. The food was outstanding| pleased everyone. The rooms and the whole resort were beautiful.,South Africa,12-09-17,No,5
Thank you Tipa,We have had 7 previous visits to Mauritius and this was personally my favourite.My family (kids 13 and 10) stayed 2 weeks in a 2 bed villa. Other reviews cover how wonderful the grounds are and how varied the restaurants are. Having stayed at several other resorts I would put this one as good as Lux Belle Mare which is in the fantastic category.What made this one special for us was the Villa and how we were looked after in it. The villa was simply amazing - it has everything and it was very tempting not to leave it!! From arrival| to Prateema sorting all our culinary delights and Reena checking we wanted for nothing the service was 5 star. Our lasting memory| both adults and kids| was how lovely our 'butler' was. Tipa (pronounced Chippa) cooked our breakfasts| produced amazing Mauritian meals and awesome barbeques. He was so nice to talk to and we left having made a friend. He gets married next year and we wish him all the best and hope to see him next August. Thank you for making it a wonderful fortnight.We will definitely come back and our only 2 comments on improvements would be to heat the villa pools (they dont get much sun and were too cold to go in) and put a little more lively entertainment on in the bar area in the evening then you might get a bit of atmosphere and some people in it.,manchester,11-09-17,No,5
Fantastic vacation,We stayed as family towards the end of our summer vacation time two weeks at Trou aux Biches. It has been an amazing and exceptional stay for us. We can only recommend the place. Special greetings as well to Fabian for super & funny Aquagym| to the whole staff for being always so nice| but also big thank you to the team at the Watersports Center for their great service. If you happen to go there around noon try to see the turtle which comes every day. ,Munich| Germany,11-09-17,No,5
Out of this world!,Amazing food! Amazing beach! Excellent staff! Great entertainment and I will defo go back again! The only thing that could be renovated is the bed! The bed is a let down! It's nothing bad but compared to other 5 stars.. the bed is a bit old and basic! ,London| United Kingdom,10-09-17,No,5
Nice place to stay and relax,Rooms are large of size| well equipped and facilities and inclusions plentiful. Only suggestion is that you are remote from towns and to eat dinner at this resort there are no options where you can wear dress shorts ,Melbourne| Australia,09-09-17,Yes,4
8 nights at Trou aux Biches beachcomber rsort,Lovely resort with great facilities| we stayed in a senior beachfront suite which was luxurious and well appointed. Service throughout the resort was friendly and efficient. Good selection of restaurants and facilities such as a gym| spa and water sports. Food and beverage is expensive and does not offer fair value. Great place to kick back and relax. I would highly recommend this resort.,Walnut Creek| California,09-09-17,Yes,5
Amazingly peaceful place with fantastic staff that make the place a heaven on earth.,Just spent a perfect two weeks at this resort. Probably the best hotel/resort experience so far. The location is perfect| the area also ideal and the resort just excellent.Resort area: loads of space| there is a long beach lined with plenty of loungers and parasols. There was never a problem getting loungers at any time of day. There is a large pool area for those with kids or who can't handle the tranquility of the beach but we hardly used it.Room: Our apartment was in a garden area| one of a number each with their own pools. It felt very private and the pool was never busy. Apartment was 'junior garden suite' with large bedroom and bathroom along with an outdoor shower area. Obviously it's Africa so well worth being careful with leaving doors open and worth using the net curtain to keep the occasional mosquitos out if using the terrace. Room had everything that was needed and more (TV seems pointless at a place like this but for those who can't live without it - it is there).Watersports: Resort has a great water sports section. Everything is free of charge unless you want to go offsite (special trips). So you can windsurf| hobie cat| water ski| kayak| snorkel the reef all for no charge. Even lessons in any of these can be arranged also free of charge (TIP: You need to book the lessons and watch the times of operation for water skiing that are posted at the water sports hut every morning).Food: Breakfast has two options; the main buffet area near the main pool which has a slightly larger selection but is busy and as production line in feel as you would expect from a resort that houses around 800. Alternatively Caravelle restaurant runs a breakfast which has a slightly smaller choice of items but is much more enjoyable and peaceful place right on the beachfront. You can even watch spinner dolphins jumping from there| just outside the reef. TIP: Caravelle is popular and there can be queues from around 9.30-10.00 (when they close). However they do not whisk away the buffet items quickly as 10 approaches so no stress. For dinner all of the restaurants offered are good quality with our favourites being the French and the adjacent Italian. TIP: Both of these have island kiosks if you want to organise a special experience. TIP: All restaurants get busy and are often fully booked so remember to plan ahead for your dinners and make reservations at the counter in the hotel reception.For lunches if you walk to the south end of the beach and out of the resort there is a small area with creole style food trucks. You can get great lunch snacks there for not much money and it will prevent boredom with the options in the hotel.Evenings: Are very quiet in the resort| the sea air seems to put everyone to sleep by around 22:30 which was fine by us. TIP: For Friday night grab a taxi to Grand Baie and check out the local run at Banana - a lively bar with live music that seems to really get going at around 23:00.Fitness: Nice gym with separate cardio and weights rooms. Plenty of tennis courts that never seemed to be fully booked with coaches available (MUR 2700 per hour).Spa: Nice spa with high quality therapists. We took a couple treatment package and had a high quality experience that we would certainly repeat. Not cheap but the quality matched the price.Overall a wonderful place| fantastic staff and not bad value compared with other top end resorts on the island. The Grand Baie area seems to get the best of the weather also| especially in the Winter months.Don't be confused by the 'Golf Resort' in the name. There is no decent golf nearby but there is a new course which has a 'soft opening' in November 2017 and will be around 15 mins drive away. I understand that Beachcomber guests will have special rates to play there. But until November you will have to drive around an hour to get to a good golf course.,Jeddah| Saudi Arabia,09-09-17,Yes,5
Postcard paradise,The resort is breathtaking. Beautiful beaches and the resort grounds are like being in a botanical garden. Staff are friendly and attentiveto yoir needs. The variety of restaurants were great we especially loved the Italian. Breakfast had good variety and the boutique store had a lot of good items to choose from. We had the family villa and it was spacious and perfect for our family of 5. Too many good things to mention available at this resort you will love it. Only thing that would make it better is the kids club needs some pepping up. The staff were not really into it and could make more effort when the kids are playing there as that is their job. Also some more service around the bar area seemed a bit slow for that level. ,Jeddah| Saudi Arabia,09-09-17,Yes,5
Awesome place| rooms and beach,Perfect hotel to enjoy Maurice| is in the North-west| perfect place for the wind in Maurice winter| the room are incredible| the garden perfects and the beach from the paradise.The service is non stress and the variety and quality of the food in the buffet is not for this kind of hotel.They need a new wine buyer.,Valladolid| Spain,08-09-17,Yes,5
Perfection!,My husband and I stayed at this resort from Sept 1- 7. We are from NY and we had never heard of the Beachcomber chain of hotels before and we were a bit wary . But this hotel exceeded our expectations! We have stayed in wonderful hotels in the Caribbean| but this is so much better. The room was huge| the outdoor shower in a grotto was magnificent. The grounds were huge| but designed so well and blended into the the natural fauna| that you don't see all the rooms. The beach is soft white sand and no waves! The water sports are great and no wait time. I loved the snorkel trips! The dining was also wonderful and food very well prepared and plentiful! The pool is large| but beautifully landscaped. The staff is delightful and so friendly! My husband and I truly loved our week here and were sad to leave. There is nothing wrong with this place!,Ny,08-09-17,Yes,5
Perfect Spot,"We came to Mauritius to finish a South African holiday with some sun and relaxation. While the weather has been cloudy and seems to be a bit cooler at this time of year the resort provided everything you could ask for. We had a suite facing the beach with a plunge pool and only had to walk across the grass for a swim. Our suite or room was very large and the bathroom extremely large with an outdoor shower as well. Unlike many plunge pools the water is reasonably warm as was the ocean water. Sitting on the deck watching the sunset from our pool or deck with a drink was fantastic. We didn't need the larger hotel pool at all. The view and colour of the water is postcard perfect.The 6 restaurants provide a good choice each night and some variation. I preferred the non-buffet restaurants as the 2 buffet restaurants are spread over a large area whereas the other restaurants provide a bit more ambiance. We had breakfast and dinner included which is a good decision as there are not too many other options close by to the same standard. Each menu has ""supplement"" courses which require you to pay but the existing menus are enough food and choice to avoid that unless you specifically want that choice of food. It is expensive here for drinks and food and we bought beers from the local ""supermarket"" which cost $2AUD verses $12AUD at the hotel for the same beer. We also bought wine from South Africa for pre dinner drinks. The local park near one end of the resort offers local meals which are great for lunch when compared to a baguette costing $30 AUD from the hotel. The resort is fantastic but just the little ways we kept an eye on costs and still enjoyed what the resort had to offer. The staff are great as everyone has commented on and go out of their way to accommodate your needs. My only disappointment was the people are allowed to smoke e-cigarettes at the table of restaurants| cigars and cigarettes while watching outdoor dancing despite some restaurants having designated smoking sections. Security is very visible everywhere which gives a great sense of comfort. Having walked along the beach in both directions this is clearly the stand out resort of this area and a long way better then the Club Med which is not too far away. The resort is an hour from the airport. ",Australia,08-09-17,Yes,5
It's so perfect| we've been for three consecutive years!,All the positive and excellent reviews about Troux aux Biche| its location and exceptional staff are true. From the outstanding gardens| sports and beauty facilities| to the manicured beach and water sports. And the food? We were always asked if there were any food allergies and great trouble was taken ensure everything was cooked as asked.Fatima welcomes you as though you are a dear and respected friend and throughout our stay| almost daily| touched base with us to ensure all was well and if we had any problems| or needed anything sorting out - Fatima gets it done with for you. No problem at all. Wonderful Fatima.Jerome Armoogum - F & B Manager - is an absolutely delightful and consummate professional. He| along with his team| have raised the quality of the already excellent food in the six restaurants to even higher heights. He meets and talks with guests every day to ensure every guests food experience/needs are met if not exceeded. Our favourite event was the beach barbecue buffet banquet| with Fire show. The food - Delicious delicious delicious!! Well done Jerome and his team.The Troux aux Biche experience is exceptional. If you can| you should holiday there.The Wainwright Family (5),Bath| United Kingdom,06-09-17,Yes,5
Our Home in Paradise..........,What can I say about Trou aux Biches well people may say there are better hotels and better views and there might be but these are not for our family. Why do I say this...... because no where in the world have we been made to feel so welcome by all the staff from senior management to the trainees learning this demanding service profession. There is something so special about the Mauritian people and their culture which is genuine and full of love that outstrips anywhere we have been around this world we live. The hotel resort is so relaxed and spans over a very wide beach front area that even in the busy times it still feel intimate and comfortable. The choice of food is second to none and dinning in the choice of six themed menu restaurants is a relaxed and pampered affair. Would we return to Trou aux Biches for our 8th holiday? Why yes ....Peter| Lisa| Fern & Anya Topping,Triolet,05-09-17,Yes,5
Everything is Possible! ,The resort is outstanding| located on one of the best beaches in Mauritius| this is a perfect winter vacation as this side of the island is protected from the wind and the sea is relatively calm and flat making it a great choice for watersport and snorkeling. 5 Star in every aspect for a resort of this size. It is well take care off (manicured gardens & well kept beach- no sea weed or coral ). The staff are exceptionally well trained and consistent in their approach| rooms are tastefully decorated and meals are prepared with finest quality ingredients.Everything is possible at the resort| nothing is a problem and if one cannot assist the staff refer a manager to immediately assist you. The Executive Assistant Manager (Fatima Chottoo) is extremely hands on| she is client facing| meets and greets every guest| engages guests during breakfast and dinner ( which can be a task as there are 6 restaurants on the resort). The restaurant managers ( Hans| Dave and Sadeck) are attentive and nothing is too much to ask. There is a choice of Thai| Indian| Italian| Mediterranean and Buffet restaurants| we had selected the half board option and were not restricted to restaurants (which can be the case at other hotels - this is something that I would caution and recommend that if you split your time between hotels get clarity on)| you would pay a discounted supplement should you select meal items out off board category.The beach staff are well trained| safety comes first. They understand the sea conditions and we felt safe with the teams. In general the Troux Biche area is well developed there are restaurants| coffee shops and a supermarket in 5-10minutes walking distance. If you want a local experience you can take a bus to Grand Baie (which is 10min away) and costs 30RS per person in comparison to 1000rs with a taxi (1 way)..we enjoyed the bus ride albeit crowdy but safe.We recommended the resort and will definitely return. We moved over to a Resorts on the East Side to experience a different side of the island and I'm already thinking this will be a difficult act to compete with Troux Biche! Well done team.Regards Farida & Alex,London| United Kingdom,05-09-17,Yes,5
very good after teething problems,We came here at the end of our honeymoon. We had been in Botswana on Safari so we hoped for some peace and luxury to finish our trip of a life time. There are some cultural issues which took us by surprise but were not really restricted to the hotel| every time my partner asked a question| the response was directed to me. sometimes| they even totally ignored her! this happened more outside of the hotel than inside. At the hotel we had a few issues at first| I won't go into them here as they were resolved to our satisfaction. The management team Fatima| Jerome and Nicolas sat down with us and heard our concerns| they were respectful and understanding and from then on our experience was much better. This is a spectacular hotel| the beach is amazing and the food is very good. most of the staff are kind and helpful. I think the one minor issue that remained was that on the beach there are a lot of vendors| in one hour| we had 5-8 come and talk to us. normally this wouldn't be a problem but they don't really accept no as a an answer and they keep going. This isn't the hotels fault| all the beaches in Mauritius are public but it doesn't lend itself to relaxation. My partner was even woken up by one to try to sell some bags. The gym was really good| and the other facilities were really nice| we got out and about a bit and really enjoyed Mauritius| it's a spectacular island. We really enjoyed our stay and were sad it had to end.,London| United Kingdom,05-09-17,Yes,5
Amazing hotel,My teenager and myself stayed at Trou Aux Biches for a week and had an absolutely stunning time. Our room was fantastic and spacious| the beach was brilliant| the hotel amenities were awesome there was nothing we missed. The great choice of restaurants was superb and each restaurant just as good as the next. The staff were always friendly and helpful| I couldn't fault it at all| we'll be back in a heart beat. ,Singapore,04-09-17,Yes,5
Stunning hotel with a few drawbacks,Stayed at the Trou aux Biches for the 2nd leg of my honeymoon and would definitely recommend it. Its a absolute stunning hotel with first class a la carte restaurants thus definitely ticks the boxes for a a honeymoon hotel. However| there were a few drawbacks with stopped it getting the full five stars:1) Little to no evening or night entertainment.2) Found the drinks especially cocktails| beers and wine expensive 3) It's very isolated (which could be a plus for some) there are no surrounding bars| nightlife or restaurant to add any variety4) Not much lighting around the hotel at night. Almost pitch black at times.5) Expected better breakfast options...... didn't feel 5 star qualityOverall| a great hotel which with a few tweaks would be a perfect hotel.,Frankfurt (Oder)| Germany,04-09-17,Yes,4
Es war fantastisch,Great 5* hotel. Just be careful if you want to keep fit cuz foods are just amazing.so easy to take some KG. Thank to Miss Fatima the Hotel manager who has always be so nice with ous. We had such a goods time in the teens club| thanks Kabz. Watersport| volleyball| movie night| henna tattoo| bowling... Impossible to get bored with him.from Lea Deutschland,Frankfurt (Oder)| Germany,04-09-17,Yes,5
Loving | Warm Retreat,I was a nanny for a family having to work on the island for the month of August . I had a beautiful room with a king size bed and a balcony with a lovely patio set. My bed was very comfortable. I had a lovely shower and soaker tub which I used a lot. Mauritius is this island paradise in the Indian Ocean. The hotel resort is on a private beach and it has all sorts of water and land sports. They have a beautiful gym and spa. There are pools in each room cluster and the people I helped had a Villa with a private pool. The staff is amazingly kind and helpful. They treated me like family| being so warm and caring. It is a large resort so many times golf carts are taken places. I walked a lot and it was very manageable. They have a great kids club with a caring staff. Children are even taken to eat and swim with this. They also can perform the Sega| a Mauritian dance| at a show. They do different events like a crab hunt and cooking. This is nice if parents want to dog to the spa or need the children to be happy with other children. The children I watched made friends from all over the world. There are 3 basic languages spoken ; French| Creole| and English. However| some words are not always understood as they are different| like the bun of a hamburger is just bread. The rope are beautiful and will kindly get you what you need when they understand. Akuna matata. If you want a beautiful| relaxing vacation| this is the place!!!! I had a magical time! It is a precious memory. ,Austin| Texas,04-09-17,Yes,5
Family Stay,This is an exceptional hotel with great restaurants| water sports and a very warm welcome from all staff. This was our second visit to this hotel and it was as good (if not better) than our first visit a year earlier. We (a family of four with children aged 11 and 14) stayed in July 2017.Welcome - We were very warmly welcomed with cold towels| cold drinks and fruit kebabs. We arrived early (12 noon) and were given an early check-in.Room - We were booked into a two bedroom family suite in block 300 (which we had pre-requested). I recommend staying in blocks 300 or 400 as these blocks are central for most amenities such as the restaurants| kids club| tennis courts| gym etc. There is a great Wi-Fi in the room and in some public areas including the restaurants. It is a little more variable in the beach area. This class of room is very spacious. We were located on the first floor| our main room had a king size bed| a balcony with a view of the garden and a partial view of the block 300 pool and a very large bathroom suite which contains a safe| some wardrobe space| minibar (alcoholic drinks| soft drinks| snacks and an iron and ironing board). The smaller room had two single beds| a minibar (soft drinks and snacks only) and an en-suite bathroom. The room was serviced twice per day (morning and evening). Restaurants – We found that for the evening| these need to be booked in advance| either early on the day and ideally the day before. Our favorites was Il Corallo (the Italian)| led fabulously by Ricardo and his team in particular Dave and Kevin; La Caravelle (French gourmet) again led by Ricardo and his team (this restaurant was great for lunch as well). The Mahiya (Indian) was also exceptional and the staff could not do enough for you - for example| we arrived one evening when the restaurant was full| there had been a mix up with our booking| but the staff still found us a table. We found Blue Ginger OK (personal taste). We did not experience the Le Deck restaurant on this visit. Evening entertainment is a little limited and the one night we waited to see the show (Bollywood show) it was cancelled.Room Service – We found that the buffet breakfast ending at 10am in the L’Oasis and La Caravelle restaurants was a little early for us. However| continental breakfast in the room is great value at 230Rs and you get to avoid the masses in the buffet breakfasts in the morning. Beach - There is a habit of people leaving towels on sunbeds early| so many beds were reserved by 9.30am. That said there were always sun beds available and the staff were always readily available to help. There are many sellers wandering the beach area (given the beach is a public area as are all beaches in Mauritius)| but they are friendly enough and not overly forceful. An improvement for the hotel would be to have a private area| but I appreciate this is outside their control. The boathouse always had availability of Kayaks| Pedalos| Hobi-Carts (lessons are available| but these need to be pre-booked at the boathouse well in advance) and water skiing (lessons are available and you just need to turn up between the published water skiing hours each day). There is also a scuba dive center which offers dives in the local area. Main Pool - There are a limited number of seats around the pool area| at peak times it can be hard to find an available sun bed.Kids club - our 11 year old went for 1 afternoon. The club is very secure| staff are very friendly and she enjoyed the cycle ride around the hotel complex.Gym/Tennis courts - Excellent facilities. The gym is small| but well equipped; the minimum age for entry is 14. There are four hard court tennis courts and two soft courts (sand). Availability of the tennis courts can be variable - for peak times (between 5pm and 7pm) the courts need to be booked early (ideally by 8am). All staff very friendly and tennis lessons available if you need them.We will definitely be back and are missing our friends at the hotel already!,Triolet,03-09-17,Yes,5
5* Holiday in every way,We visited Trou aux Biches in July on the Escape package for a family of 5 and stayed in the family rooms with 2 bedrooms - 2 bathrooms and outside shower. We loved everything about the resort. The food and presentation in all the restaurants was amazing - our favourites were the Thai and La Caravelle where the staff were exceptional. We enjoyed the water sports and the beach team were very friendly and patient with the children. Special mention also to Kabz in the teens club who managed to create a fun time for all nationalities - thank you from the Crabtree girls. And finally Fatima the manager who was visible every day at different times chatting to her guests and making us all feel welcome - when our daughter had a reaction to a bite late one evening she sat with us at reception waiting for a doctor and personally applied Calamine lotion - no wonder the resort is a pleasure to visit with Fatima at the helm.,Ballyclare| United Kingdom,02-09-17,Yes,5
Trou aux Biches Hotel| Mauritius ,Beautiful grounds and a spectacular location enhance this very well staffed hotel. A large pool and five more secluded pools| Vila's are very well arranged to offer very private accommodation. Good choice of restaurants onsite. Staff are very friendly. Perfect sunsets over the sea and amble watersport facilities - paddle boards| skiing| windsurfing| hobie cats and kayaks - all free top it off| great spot!,Winchester| United Kingdom,31-08-17,Yes,5
Perfect Beach vacation,"This was our first holiday at the Trou aux Biches Beachcomber Hotel. We had rented a two-bedroom-pool-villa with private butler-service from 8 a.m. till 2 p.m. and were lucky to get a free upgrade to a three-bedroom-pool-villa. The accomodation was great: very clean| cosy and luxurious with lots of space and a large private outdoor-area with eating- and lounge-area and a very clean private Pool. Our butler Lata (thank you so much for your help!) was perfect| she served a wonderful breakfast every morning on our terrace with all kind of delicious stuff we wanted. She helped us with all the organisation around our stay at the villa and almost developped a kind of ""part of the Family"". Aditionally| thanks to Reena and Nobin who also bothered perfectly about us to make our stay at our villa unforgettable! We already plan to come back",Winchester| United Kingdom,30-08-17,Yes,5
Nice but expensive,Lovely place but very expensive for drinks and food. Each drink was about £10 so a round of drinks for a family of 5 worked out quite expensive.Also a meal in the buffet was about £50 per person. If we went again we'd probably consider full or half board rather than B&BMost trips/sight seeing opportunities were in the South of the island so a long journey before starting the trips.Great friendly staff| spacious rooms and lovely beach. It was just the expense that was a little disappointing.,Winchester| United Kingdom,30-08-17,Yes,3
Super Paradise,Just paradise. should at least be visited once in life. huge hotel with a perfect service. Thanks to Kabz and Barack from the teens who take care of us and entertaining all the time.Negative point| i dont understand why each time| a mum forced us to play with her 8yo kid| I came to the teens club to meet new teens not small kids. This was so annoying.,London| United Kingdom,29-08-17,Yes,5
Top Top !,We've visited Mauritius in February. Great stay| great staff| great room(except for those cockroaches)| great food and drinks| great time Total recommendation to all with or without kids!!! We've planed to see the whole island but the time in resort was so good we didnt even went out :) so we have reason to come back for sure!,Coventry| United Kingdom,29-08-17,Yes,5
Relaxing Family Holiday,After two flights and 16 hours of traveling we arrived at reception at 8pm where we were instantly whipped to our villa in a golf buggy with our luggage and greeted with a cold drink and some snacks. We were introduced to Anusha who was going to be looking after us and we were given a guided tour of our beautiful villa. For the next ten days we were in Paradise. The staff were all amazing. Nothing was too much trouble and they were all so friendly. Every member of staff we met were a credit to the resort. The resort is impeccable| so beautiful and so grand. Everything seems so new. The gym is very nice and has all the latest equipment. The tennis courts are great too.The villa was just wow! the biggest most comfortable bed! Amazing bathrooms| beautiful pool area (little cold but it is winter). We were also looked after by Anusha who made us breakfast everyday and cleaned the villa everyday she was so helpful and nothing was too much trouble.The beach and water sports are great and easy to sort out. There are people that keep trying to sell items like jewellery and clothes but a polite no and they go away.Food wise there's a lot of choice but if you are a fussy eater you may struggle in certain restaurants where the menus fixed but it was all very nice. In the evening the entertainment was different sometimes good sometimes well not so! If there is a downside the alcohol is quite expensive which kept the bar fairly quiet.All in all I would highly recommend this resort as it's a home from home and the staff become family.Thanks to all who made us have the most relaxing holiday,Coventry| United Kingdom,28-08-17,Yes,5
Great honey moon,Very nice hotel and staff. Rooms are amazing and many activities to do in the beach. We will repeat for sure. A bad point is that you think it will be all inclusive but you find many restrictions (supplements) in the bar and menus... ,Triolet,28-08-17,Yes,5
A holiday in paradise,We spent a week here for our anniversary and enjoyed every minute. Everything about the place was excellent; the service| the rooms| the facilities| the staff and the food. We hardly wanted to leave the hotel for any day trips etc as everything there was all we needed. The complementary watersports facilities and staff were so good we went waterskiing each day.All food was excellent with the Restaurant Caravelle being the best| in our opinion| with great service. Be sure to make your reservation to avoid disappointment.The room was spacious| clean and very comfortable.Good tennis courts and gym facilities| different studio classes are available each day| if you're looking for yoga| pilates or anything similar you may be disappointed.Overall though the lack of this did not upset our stay as everything else was so excellent.,London,27-08-17,Yes,5
Nice vacation,"The place is great! The beach is a white sand beach and clean. There are also too many stray dogs and locals that try to sell you things. A little to friendl and anoying too| especially if you want to rest. The european summer is winter for them| so be prepared to have showers ( rain) quite often. Not so many indoor activities but you can always rent a car (rent one| don't take the offers from the local turism companies as these are too expensive and you don't see much). and visit the island. Food is reaaally good ( and expensive ~50 eur pp) and the staff is really nice and helpful.The room (junior suite) is pretty big. The bed is huge and we slept with the junior as the baby bed was quite ""used"". Bathroom is huge| the outdoor shower was amazing. The hotel has way to many ratings from ""1 review"" users :) and I don't think is necessary as the place is really good. They cleaned our room twice per day| there was someone taking care of our minibar on daily basis| changes the towels twice per day| and we had water every day. If you like to spend your vacation in the resort only| there are also water activities that you can do. If you are the kind that wants to discover the island on it's own| then be prepared to understand that the paradise ends once you are out of the resort :)All together we enjoyed our stay!",Blace| France,27-08-17,Yes,4
Grat stay,The resort is a paradise| no complains at all. The overall service is a real 5 stars. The quality of the food is amazing| especially at the Corallo restaurant. Only negative point of our stay was the weather| but obviously there is nothing to do. We will go back again.,Blace| France,25-08-17,No,5
relax in paradise,beautifully situated on the white beach the atmosphere is amazing.The service is first class and the installations are the same.The dimensions of the resort are enormous in a way that it does not feel crowded.,Blace| France,24-08-17,No,4
Wonderful... the best yet in Mauritius,Our 4th time to Mauritius and the best hotel yet.. the facilities and restaurants were superb. This is a five star hotel and each of the restaurants reflect this as do the staff. A telling sign is that if you complain they don't try and justify the way they do things - they seek to find a solution that suits you - not that we had much cause for complaint... I recomend all the restaurants - the Indian and Thai have menus that change every 3 days the others are more fixed. The buffet is generous and if you ask most things can be found for you| the wine also was of a better quality than we'd had at other hotels.I've seen other mention full restaurants and having to wait a few days for things - this is very much the nature of the beast - you have to plan and book in advance| talk to the staff they'll guide you.For the disabled or wheelchair user... a few bits| the beach is not accessible in a wheelchair - the hotel does have disabled rooms and the one we had had a separate adapted bathroom. The hotel as many adapted toilets which are in sensible places - although some of the restaurants don't. They have made a big effort but be warned on a few points:- the beds are very low so hard to get out of- the entrance to our room - most rooms have a step but this had been altered to a ramp which is good - however| the door opens outwards and is on an automatic (spring operated) closer. So I could get to the door - pop my entry card in and then I had to go backwards| down the ramp. Needing to brake I couldn't hold the door open and it shuts automatically! I could find a way to get in the room - fortunately they have tons of staff so getting help wasn't a problem!,Blace| France,24-08-17,Yes,5
Family Holiday,Certainly a great location. The hotel offers everything you could ask for| on the surface. Underneath its riddles with annoying issues. I will use the snorkelling as a prime example...this is off of the beach accessed by boat| you get 3 time slots| my family were very keen| but you had to book and the first slot for us was 3 days time. My daughter wanted to have windsurfing lesson| this was 4-5 days to wait. The tennis courts are 'free' but you pay for new balls. The cost of day to day items ridiculous| I mean snacks| drinks and incidentals. If you decide to eat out at Grand Baie for instance| and there are more than 4 of you| do not use the hotel for this. Their arrangements are ridiculous and can be obtained much more cheaply. Its a great venue| but I would recommend going when they offer an All Inclusive (not available in August) if you go with the family. Take your tennis balls and get to the boat house straightaway if their are things you want to do on the water.,Bristol| United Kingdom,21-08-17,Yes,3
very nice place,excellent location| with friendly stuff and very good facilities. Excellent choice for couples and families also. The food was little expensive though| but anyway| I'd love to have the opportunity to visit this place again.,Copenhagen| Denmark,20-08-17,Yes,5
Perfect location for sunsets| water activities| and relaxing,We had our family vacation with the teenagers in Mauritius this year. It was probably the best vacation we’ve had together. We got two rooms next to each other with a connecting door. The rooms were big| the beds were comfy| and we were right on the beach. The resort is huge| but it didn’t feel like it as we were at the very end. The kids had the freedom to go out and enjoy the beach or the workout rooms and we didn’t have to worry about where they were. Water activities were included in our package. Take advantage of it: paddle boards| wind surfing| kayak| glass bottom boat rides| snorkeling| water skiing| and more. Even if you haven’t signed up for one of the times| show up anyway. There are always cancelations.There are locals also wandering the beach to sell you everything from trinkets to boat rides. I was concerned that it was going to be too much| but they left us alone after awhile. If you’re going to buy something| get the price in rupees. It can be difficult to hear the difference between 15 and 50 euros when they give you a price. Be sure you know what you’re paying before you do the activity.The Beachcomber offers a couple of different meal packages. We went with the B&B so we could take advantage of their extensive breakfast buffet. It is worth it. You MUST try the white tuna they serve. It is wonderful! We were also regulars at the crepe station and the poached egg and omelette stations. We met others that went with the half board to get 2 meals / day. We enjoyed getting out and trying the local restaurants which were diverse and very good. The 3 times we stayed in to eat| we had the dinner buffet. It was easy (no reservations necessary) and gave a lot of options for the whole family (including a nice wine list). They have five other restaurants there that we didn’t have a chance to try. Book your table early if you want to try the other restaurants.The staff was professional and friendly throughout the resort. For us this covered all the S’s: sunshine| service| and smiles. We’ll be back.,Copenhagen| Denmark,20-08-17,Yes,5
One of the original luxury resorts in Mauritius,I am originally from Mauritius and prefer to stay at the original luxury resorts. Trou aux Biches resort is one of the original Beachcomber properties dating back to the 70's and as such| has claim to one of the most beautiful beaches in Mauritius where you will get consistently good weather. The property is expansive and its grounds have matured beautifully. Over the years| there have been many renovations and the resort remains updated. Our family was upgraded to two connecting tropical suites that were beachfront| each with a small plunge pool. The rooms were huge| as were the adjoining bathroom suites and outdoor showers. Each block of rooms also has a pool| as well as a huge pool at the main lobby/buffet area. A good choice of a la carte restaurants available| the Italian very good. Special thanks to Heetesh and Belinda at reception who helped us with our upgrade and our late checkout. Will defintely return to this property again next year.,Toronto| Canada,19-08-17,Yes,5
First family trip to Mauritius,Overall we had a lovely week in Mauritius staying at the hotel but I think a week was enough at this time of the year. We knew before going the north west was best this time of year as quite windy and cooler but overall we were very lucky with the weather with just one day wet and cloudy. The three children spent nearly every day at the beach within 5 minutes from our room which was safe and easy to play in the sea cordoned off from the boats and trips. All the coral near the shore is dead so limited fish and snorkelling. The free trips out in the lagoon on the glass bottom boat were disappointing only because the coral is mainly dead. The snorkelling a little farther out marginally better. We made as much us of the free sea activities but they get booked up days ahead. To that end we paid a company to go on a snorkelling trip and also swam with wild dolphins which was amazing. The speed boat to yourself 4000 MRS.We were B&B and the breakfast buffet was everything we needed for all of us with choices and service. You have to walk or taxi for the outside restaurants we had researched on Trip Advisor but they were great and superb value for money. sadly the hotel lunches and dinners were not great value for money and in fact very expensive and less interesting than the outside local ones. Rooms lovely but service generally not quite 5 star in the bars and restaurants. Overall impression would not go all inclusive with family as food choices way better 10-15 minutes walk away and it really is not 5 star in the western or middle east world.,Abu Dhabi| United Arab Emirates,16-08-17,Yes,3
Best holiday ever,We had an amazing week here and loved everything about our stay: villa| service| food all superb. And we were looked after brilliantly well every day by Lata| nothing was too much trouble. The villa was always perfect and we had a really tasty private breakfast every day. Thank you!,Belfast| United Kingdom,14-08-17,Yes,5
An idyllic resort,My husband and I stayed here in a wonderful beachfront villa for one week. It was one of the most relaxing holidays we have had. We spent our mornings lounging on the beach and afternoons on the deck in the villa or at our small 'local' pool. It was winter there in July but temperatures reached 26 degrees and with the breeze from the Indian Ocean it remained pleasant and warm for us at all times. We ate at a different restaurant every night| which is included in our Escape package. We booked them all at the beginning of our stay and then went back to Caravelle for our last night for their desserts! We breakfasted by the pool every morning just outside L'Oasis and were very well looked after by Jeetoo| Nitish and Veenaye.Friday night we dined on the beach and had a beach barbecue at le Deck. This was one of the highlights of our week and the array of different meats| seafood and salads on offer did not disappoint. Here we were so impressed by the service and by our waiter| Ranjit| who was so attentive and efficient that we returned here on the Sunday| our last day. When we arrived| Ranjit had made sure that there was a bottle of champagne already chilling for us! The Sunday barbecue was equally delicious as we had expected. If you want to just totally chill| to enjoy great food and excellent service in paradise surroundings| and something a little bit special then this Trou aux Biches is for you. ,Belfast| United Kingdom,13-08-17,Yes,5
Teens club,The teens club at the hotel was great| especially the two main leaders| Kabz and Barak. They made the experience very enjoyable and ensured that everyone was getting as much as they possibly could out of the holiday.,Harpenden| United Kingdom,11-08-17,Yes,5
Mauritius - Heaven. 9.5/10,This was our 5th Family holiday to Mauritius and 4th Hotel| and by far the most relaxing holiday we have ever had. After the 2nd day my wife and I both said it felt like we had been there at least a week| we were so chilled.from arrival we felt relaxed| we checked in at the villa rather than waiting in reception| we also checked out from the villa prior to being driven to reception to collect our transfer to the airport.We had a 2 Bed villa| which was huge| a fully fitted and equipped kitchen| dinning area and large lounge with TV dvd player etc. To one side of the villa was a double bedroom with large en-suite to the other side of the Villa is the Master bedroom with large seperate dressing room with his/hers sinks ample wardrobe and draw space| a very large wet floor rain shower. Outside the Master bathroom is a walled area with and outside double bath and separate shower. In the central court yard a good-sized plunge pool and two dining areas| a BBQ and seating in the open or a dinning table under the eves of the villa| and a shaded sitting area.And as if that wasn’t enough we had a butler| Preetum| who was just fantastic. Depending an what we were doing on any given day he would arrive to cook breakfast and clean and tidy the Villa and serve drinks etc.. He took the time to find out what we liked and wanted; be it cereal my daughters' wanted for breakfast or how I liked my G&T.. He was very professional| polite| friendly| discreet and caring.. And to be honest he made us feel so relaxed and at home. They don’t have an ALL-Inc package for the Villas so we had HB. This meant we could dine in the villa with room service and pay only a tray service supplement| or we could arrange for our Butler and a Chef to cook in the villa for us| would BBQ and Mauritian food cooked and served for us. On a couple of nights we had room service the night Butler would set the table| serve and then clear away.The hotel grounds are large and our Villa was about as far from reception as possible| and we did make use of the Club Car service in the evening to go to dinner| as it is a good 4min drive| or a wonderful 15-20min stroll back to stretch your legs after diner.The hotel facilities are fantastic| 6 restaurants (recommend you book in advance although we never had a problem getting in anywhere) If you have young children or teens they will always find something they like. The Thai and Indian restaurants offer a set menu which changes regularly. Our daughter like very mild chicken curry and both restaurants were happy to cook this for them. After all Happy children make happy parents.The only criticism we had was that the service in ALL restaurants was very slow and almost impossible to get anyone attention. On a couple of occasions I had to leave the table to get someone. Out of the 6 swimming pools only one is heated and this is in area 3| as this is close to and used by the kids club when they have pool activities. There is a full schedule for the kids club and we found that there a 3 groups catered for babies up to 9ish 10-13 and a separate Teen club. They can either stay or come and go| it’s up to you.The usual Sailing Snorkelling Pedalos Paddle /boards and Windsurfing are free to guests. At the boat house you can arrange boat trips such as swimming with dolphins and other excursions. As with the whole of Mauritius ALL beaches are public and therefor you will get traders trying to sell shell and gifts| boat trips| floatie ride etc. But if you are on the hotel grounds they are not allowed to enter. Security was discreet but visible. Having stayed in the East South and West of Mauritius this area in the North West was great| we stayed 16nights and only had a two wet days| not forgetting this is their winter.We scuba dive and there is a PADI dive centre in the hotel. They guys there a very helpful and will discuss the type of dives you want to do. My Wife and eldest daughter (12) did their 4 Open Water dives to complete their PADI Certificate. Just a couple of things to look our for at the Dive Centre My wife wore a full length wet suit my daughter and I wore shortie wetsuits and our legs were eaten alive we both counted 60bite on each leg | my wife had two. They could also do with having a supply of fresh towels to dry off with after your dive/shower.There is a Spa| Gy| Golf| Bikes and so much more if you want itOVER ALL ..9.5/10 and can’t wait to go back,Tonbridge| United Kingdom,10-08-17,Yes,5
Relaxing experience,Had a lovely relaxing time with perfect setting. Loved the sunsets every night! Staff exceptional! Facilities great. Only negative was that you have to book in advance for the few restaurants and weren't always available.,Zurich| Switzerland,10-08-17,Yes,5
Perfect retreat with excellent service,We spent a very relaxing couple of weeks in this resort in Mauritius: the layout of the resort - small units in an extensive opulent garden resembling a botanical garden with palm trees| bordring the beach and the sea. In between there are numerous pools and 5 different excellent restaurants ( Indian| Thai| Italian| French| Mauritian...) | and an excellent choice of water sports - canoes| windsurf| Hobie Cat sailing| snorkeling| waterski - there is also a diving school with excellent facilities and frequent diving options. But the most important asset are the people: an absolute commitment to friendly service make your stay a memorable one!,Zurich| Switzerland,10-08-17,Yes,5
Good but not great ,The grounds and layout of the hotel are beautiful| it has a lot of space and rooms are large and not on top of each other like many other Mauritian hotels. Definitely one of the more aesthetically pleasing hotels in the island. The rooms are very nicely done| very comfortable. The wifi is good| not great and there are dead spots. Close to Grand Baie which is ideal for business visits. The issues with this is that it has deals with numerous tour companies| as such they get very large parties coming through which can mean very over crowded restaurants and bars. The hotel is very large and caters for a lot of people| so this can detract from the feeling of being on a tropical island. The waiters and Bartenders are slow and not up to standard of the best hotels. Sometimes ignoring you completely until you leave your set and walk up to them for service. The food at the restaurants is overpriced and not as good as it should be. Overall| great location| rooms and amenities. Staff and food to improve. ,Zurich| Switzerland,09-08-17,Yes,3
nice hotel| friendly staff| lots of water activities,spent our honeymoon there| spent 9 nights. rooms are specious| staff is friendly| couple of restaurants within hotel resorts| quite expensive though (100-120 € for 2) when outside the resort you get just as good food for half the prize.,Zurich| Switzerland,09-08-17,Yes,4
Paradise found.,Just lovely! We stayed in room 600 ( beach suite with pool) at the quieter end of the resort. The room was spacious andserviced twice a day with fresh bedding every other day. The bathroom is huge and the outdoor shower area is a special luxury. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. We were upgraded to the escape package as we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary. This included a bottle of champagne| fruit and a gift of prints in our room. Dinner on one night was at a special table with rose petals and a celebration cake.The staff training must be excellent. All staff| including waiters| room care| grounds maintenance and security are helpful| smiley and knowledgeable. The variety of restaurants is good and we had breakfast and lunch at Caravelle most days. We enjoyed all the other restaurants and the variety keeps it interesting. This restaurant had fabulous views of the beach and was convenient for our room.There is filming going on near by and a couple of times we passed Matt McConaughey and other Hollywood A listers! There is so much thought going into every detail - quality beach towels| comfy sun loungers| a good supply of bathroom goods (lovely fragrance)and fabulous service all the way. A fabulous holiday! ,Manchester| United Kingdom,09-08-17,Yes,5
Outstanding ,We've just come back from a 9 night stay at this excellent resort with three children in tow (15|12 and 1). What can I say - well it was the holiday of a lifetime. The resort| the island| the people and the culture were all outstanding. We stayed in a two bedroom villa with private pool. This was a most excellent choice for accommodation as it has ample space both inside and out and came with a butler from 8-2 every day. Our butler was Poonam who we all fell in love with and we felt she was part of the family by the end of the trip. She was so pleasant and helpful and made us fantastic breakfasts each morning in our villa (much better than going to the buffet at is was served when we woke up and we could eat in our pjs next to our pool...bliss!). She was also amazing with our 1 year old baby and he screamed with delight each morning when she would arrive. Our villa also had an outside bath which we loved to use at the end of the day with a glass of wine and some music. The food in the resort was amazing - every meal was fantastic| we especially loved the Indian and the Thai restaurants and the traditional Mauritian cooking made by and served to us in the villa by Poonam. We had one night at the villa alone where my husband cooked a BBQ (all food provided by the resort) which was lovely. We really enjoyed the watersports on offer although the red flag was up a lot meaning we felt best to stay off the water. Water was lovely and refreshing even though it was the depths of winter. Service around the resort was wonderful. All very joined up - we had lots of allergies in our group and we told one person this once and suddenly all the restaurants knew all about it and were prepared. We had one issue with not know who to book excursions through and that was sorted with the highest level of efficiency thanks to Reena the villa manager who was also fantastic. The design of the resort was beautiful. Not a plastic deck chair in sight - all blended beautifully into the gorgeous surroundings. The main pool was massive but looked like a water feature not a giant tacky blue pool. Everything we needed was well and truly taken care of and we could just relax! Massive plus for my husband who has a massively stressful job and needs holidays that get his resting heart rate back within the normal zone. The beach was stunning and had a lovely vibe. We really enjoyed our visits there every day and the baby loved playing in the sand and paddling in the little waves. The sunsets you will see at this resort will be some of the best in the world. One major bonus was the baby corner service run from 1-4 every weekday for 1-3 year olds too young for the kids club. We didn't know about this beforehand so was very happily surprised to find it was on offer and free which meant we could do watersports or go off campus for a relaxing lunch. The same lady was assigned to our baby to look after him during these sessions (sadly I never caught her name but she was amazing and our baby loved her a lot) and she also did all of our babysitting in the evenings which is their policy and I think an amazing touch to keep babies happy and content. On that note - all of the staff were very baby obsessed and made us feel like royalty for having a baby in tow and constantly wanted to hold him and play with him which he loved. Very different to the Uk where babies are seen as an pain in luxury hotels. The only downside things to note are:1) heat of the pools - there's only one heated pool onsite which we had to use for the baby as the other pools were too cold for him. I didn't mind the temp of the other pools at all but the rest of the family found them rather bracing. Better for the environment to not have all the pools heated of course. I would imagine this wouldn't be a problem in summer as the sun would heat the pools. 2) final cost - we were on half board and our final bill for lunches| supplements| drinks| laundry etc was eye watering on top of an already very expensive holiday. We could have been much smarter though and realised towards the end of the holiday that eating off campus at local restaurants for lunch was far cheaper. I'm sure we could have found somewhere to buy cheap wine for in the villa too. 3) level of fun factor for teenagers - they have a very comprehensive teen club but our teenager wouldn't go on her own and was worried they would largely speak French as with previous Club Med holidays| so that meant she was left with us and found the evenings to be a bit boring. There was entertainment offered each night but it was fairly sedate and well behaved. A few of the adults we spoke to also said they wished there was more rowdy/fun bars and entertainment on offer. All depends on what you want though because my husband was very happy with the entertainment and level of fun. 4) weather - it's their winter at this time of year so do expect some rain| chilly moments and cloud cover| plus sunset is at about 6.30 at night so don't expect long light evenings. I loved the weather because it was still warm enough to feel like we were on holiday but not too hot to make managing the baby in the heat a problem. All in all we loved our time there and will most definitely be back (which is something we never do| always opting to visit somewhere new). Thanks TAB for an unforgettable holiday that is currently at the #1 spot on our list of top holidays. ,Hunstanton| United Kingdom,08-08-17,Yes,5
Wonderful Setting - First class facilities,"The second of our three hotels on tour. A bit of paradise less windy than Tamassa. Beach side location - a paddlers paradise! I think we increased the average age somewhat - younger folk were enjoying water sports| swimming and all the good things that they wanted. we enjoyed walks and excursions.The a la carte restaurants are excellent and varied - remember to reserve in advance.The hotel caters for all tastes but being large there are often corporate groups enjoying boding and personal development opportunities.We met a French gentleman on the beach who was living out there. Every day he and his Golden Labrador dog ""Cashmere"" came to the idyllic shore. He told us that ""Cashmere"" swam about 7 kilometres a day trying|without success| to catch the little fish you see in the crystal clear water. Mauritius is a country of charming people who work hard. The cost of living is attractive to retirees.Our room was attractive and well appointed. Strangely we saw no sea birds | but weaver birds were nesting in the gardens which were full of birdsong and tropical trees and plants.The only disappointment was that I had to insist that we were not part of an ""Oldies Club"" to be herded and directed where and when to eat but that we were independent individual travellers paying for exclusive all inclusive quality choice- Saga were our Travel Agents not ""a pensioners club"". This misunderstanding marred our once in a lifetime holiday and was pervasive throughout our stay at TAB. I think it was possibly down to one senior member of staff who lacked the wonderful Mauritian welcoming personality we had come to expect elsewhere on the island.Being British we made the best of things and determined not to let it spoil our holiday enjoyment. TAB has wonderful facilities but its staff are not as personable| friendly and welcoming as our previous hotel Tamassa.",Hunstanton| United Kingdom,07-08-17,No,4
a good experience,We stayed at the resort for eight days during July and found it a wonderful experience. the rooms are large and well-appointed. We especially enjoyed the outdoor showers. The rooms are serviced quite early in the day which I always enjoy. If anything is ordered from room service| it arrives timeously. The speciality restaurants are great and the main dining room is buffet style and there is always interesting food available. The breakfasts have a large variety of foods. A special place to stay.,Port Elizabeth| South Africa,05-08-17,No,4
A great stay,Except for some minor issues| we had two excellent weeks at this resort. Friendly staff| good and varied food as well as a spacious and nice suite.If I find something to be a bit disappointed with then they are quite small areas to swim on the beach. Depending on all boat traffic with water skiers| windsurfers| glass bottom boats| etc. Even the snorkeling at the reef off the beach was disappointing.,Hong Kong| China,03-08-17,Yes,4
Excellent Experience,Very pleased with the welcome we recieved.Pleased with the rooms and services.Enjoyed the buffet at the Restaurants.Enjoyed the Night Entertainments.Beautiful Scenery .Adrenalin Activities provided.,Hong Kong| China,02-08-17,Yes,5
Amazing holiday| Wedding & honeymoon,A huge thank you to all the staff at beachcomber| especially Karen & Chris & the hotel resort staff Fiona| Ally| Kavita & Dave| for making our dreams come true in creating our perfect wedding & honeymoon The food was lovely in the whole of the resort but our favourite was the Italian. Thank you again for this truly magical experience ,Hong Kong| China,31-07-17,Yes,5
Big crowded but still pleasant Hotel,Nice Hotel but too big and too crowded making it difficult to relax ! Also| there were too many sales people selling clothes and bracelets and it became bothering as it was too repetitive. Overall| the hotel was still pleasant with many things to do as there were great facilities including a gym and great tennis courts.The kids also had a lot of fun in the teens club as there were great games and animators such as kabz and Ludovik (Barack Obama). The animators were extremely nice and funny. Thanks to them!,Hong Kong| China,31-07-17,Yes,3
An excellent option to stay at Maurtius,Probably it is not the cheapest hotel in the Island| but the highest standards of its services worth to pay a bit more. I was with my family and it was simply fantastic! Staff is devoted to its work and will make your visit to Mauritius simply unforgettable. Food quality is also noticiable and the beach activities really really good| though snorkling needed to be book several days before as it was very demanded (and great!).,Madrid| Spain,31-07-17,Yes,5
2 Bed Villa with pool,This was our first visit to the Trou aux Biches and we were not disappointed. The hotel setting is beautiful and the facilities are fantastic. We would definitely recommend a visit to the spa during your stay. The treatments were wonderful and the therapists were very friendly and professional. As part of our package we had a butler service| this enabled us to thoroughly relax. We would like to give a special mention to our butler Lata who made our stay such a great experience. Nothing was too much trouble for her and we appreciated everything she organised for us. Lata is a real asset to the hotel and we hope to see her again when we return to Trou aux Biches. The only negative thing we experienced during our stay was how some of the guests were treating the staff| it would have been nice to see the management supporting their staff at these times. ,Paris| France,31-07-17,Yes,5
Breathtaking view,I did enjoy every single moment of my stay! Besides the amazing hotel| activities and gorgeous view| the staff is warm and welcoming. Make sure to visit the kids and teens club. Ludovic and Kabz were very funny and made my stay even more enjoyable. Highly recommend this place. ,Paris| France,30-07-17,Yes,5
Outstanding Service and Standards,This resort is easily justifiable of its 5* status. Having worked in the hospitality industry myself| I genuinely appreciate the incredible charm and service of the staff| combined with the luxurious and well- maintained accommodation. The restaurants are outstanding and the Kids Club| personalised in order that each child feels safe and cared for in the environment.,Knysna| Western Cape| South Africa,30-07-17,No,5

Janette's 70th birthday,Highly enjoyable but not quite 5star standard. Our initial room had an awful smell and we had to really negotiate to be moved to another similar room after 3 hours.There was an irregularity with the minibar which was resolved.Our dinner reservation for my wifes birthday was not recorded and we could not have the dinner of our choice on that night.,Klerksdorp| South Africa,27-07-17,Yes,4
Dreamy time in Mauritius,We had a fabulous time at this hotel. We stayed in a beautiful 2 bedroom villa with its own pool and outdoor bathroom with shower - a really luxurious treat. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive and looked after us beautifully. We enjoyed all of the restaurants - hard to pick a favourite but I think the Thai just clinched it. We also very much enjoyed the barb-e-que and Mauritian cuisine we enjoyed in our villa - the Mauritian cuisine probably being my own favourite. Incredibly flavourful curry as opposed to blow your socks off heat. The boat house staff also lovely and particularly with the water skiing - their instruction was second to none and they really want each individual to progress and get to the next level. Perhaps next time the weather could be arranged so that it is a little less cloudy...?,Sevenoaks| United Kingdom,27-07-17,Yes,5
A dream,All perfect. The place is beautifull| the beach very good. Restourants are very good with a lot oh choises. Rooms are amazing especially the suite villa in the beach. The north of the island is Greta . ,Hull,27-07-17,Yes,5
A...Ma.....zing!,We stayed at Trou Aux Biches for our honeymoon and it was absolutely amazing. The hotel was exactly as advertised and even better than the brochure.The staff we so friendly and helpful and everyone made us feel welcome.The hotel was kept in pristine condition| they even swept the beach every morning!The six restaurants mean you will never get bored of the food| as it an be different everyday| and the water sports mean there is lots to do without even leaving the hotel.I never look to go to the same hotel twice| but I would definitely return here!,Hull,25-07-17,Yes,5
best service ever,we stayed at this hotel for a week .we are a family of 5 that includes two teenagers.the service from the staff was great .I must mention the resort manager - she has her finger on the pulse! .great restaurants|watersports and the garden setting accomodation is private and contribute to a relaxed admosphere..Our expectations were met and exceeded.,Cape Town| South Africa,25-07-17,Yes,5

Best Hotel Ever!,We have just returned from 2 weeks at this beautiful hotel and I can honestly say we were blown away. We were renewing our wedding vows for our 10th Wedding Anniversary and this Hotel was recommended by our personal Travel Counsellor. She couldn't have picked a more perfect place for us| the beach front suite had the most breathtaking views of the powder white sandy beach and turquoise blue sea - both me and my Husband actually cried when we were shown our room| it was so beautiful. Everything is clean and well kept and the staff are absolutely amazing. We were greeted at Reception by the lovely Fatima who then made sure she checked on us every single day to make sure we were having the best time. My wedding co-coordinator Fiona was totally amazing - she made the whole process completely stress free| made sure every last detail was taken care of and made 100% sure that our ceremony was everything that I had dreamt of and more. Finally a massive shout out to our lovely little Dave| our waiter in the Caravelle Restaurant - what a wonderful man| we will miss him for sure. I literally cannot put into words how beautiful this Hotel is and I will definitely be returning!,Harlow| United Kingdom,23-07-17,Yes,5
Excellent hotel. Clean and well organised. The staff were so friendly| welcoming and accommodating.,We stayed here with our one year old son on our honeymoon. We were very well looked after there and I haven't got a bad word to say about this hotel and the staff. The only advice I would offer people is to stay there when it is not school holidays (if you have the choice) as it is quieter and less busy then.,Southend-on-Sea| United Kingdom,23-07-17,No,5
July 2017 Holiday,We have just had two weeks at this hotel for the 2nd time. I cannot fault this hotel the staff are amazing. I would like to thank the following people for making this holiday unforgettable. Vikram from housekeeping who was always cheerful and kept our room spotless. Menon in the Caravelle restaurant for whom nothing was too much trouble and his staff| Dinesh| Laval| Kavita and Ravi who were always welcoming and attentive. The food was always lovely. The grounds were fantastically kept. I would also recommend the dive centre and cannot thank James & David enough for letting me go on the boat while my husband was diving. The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable with lovely views over the gardens. I have to say everybody at the hotel was very friendly and would have no hesitation about returning.,Ringwood| United Kingdom,23-07-17,No,5
Celebrating a special birthday,Fabulous hotel but made even more awesome by the attention and customer service we received from the staff. Sadek from L'Oasis restaurant could not have been anymore attentive to our dietary requirements and took a personal interest to ensure we had sufficient choice at each meal time. His team were so personal and friendly| nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed a special birthday meal at L'Caravelle restaurant| the table was set beautifully and we were surprised by a birthday cake too. Sajit the room supervisor was also very attentive checking we were comfortable. We were so sad to leave as we felt we had made friends with the hotel staff. Everyone made our holiday a memorable one. Thank you to everyone at the hotel.,Solihull| United Kingdom,23-07-17,No,5
Wedding trip,Adjourning rooms for family with two children. Spacious| clean rooms with large extensive bathrooms with bath and indoor/outdoor showers. Very nice fixtures fittings and amenities. Friendly hard working staff and a number of excellent restaurants| though must book for all of them. Not inexpensive but certainly worth it.,Suffolk| United Kingdom,22-07-17,No,5
Excellent July family holiday,The grounds were fantastic| the food was fantastic| the service was always friendly| always efficient and never over-bearing. The facilities were perfect for us with a daily game or two of tennis to stave off too much laziness and hours on the water teaching the children how to sail. The room we had (a family suite) was huge| very comfortable| incredibly quiet - I even managed one twelve our sleep - not achieved since my own childhood and unlikely to be repeated ever in the cacophony of my own home!,Mossel Bay| South Africa,22-07-17,No,5
Nice resort,Our stay for 7 nights was overall pleasant.The positive points:Nice resort and gardensNice beachSatisfactory variety and quality of buffet mealsThe attitude of the concierge personnelThe room was quite spaciousThe group classes at the gymThe so-and-so points:The attitude of the personnel at the Oasis bar and buffet.The low temperature of the pool water.The low temperature in the room.The refill of our mini bar was repeatedly forgotten| although we had paid for the escape package. Numerous reminders.,Mossel Bay| South Africa,21-07-17,Yes,4
Fantastic Family holiday,Had a great time at Trou Aux Biches Beachcomber with the family. We were on the Escape package which made eating and drinking much less complicated. If you can afford it and you are staying for a minimum period of a week then I would strongly recommend it. The food was consistently of exceptional quality and cocktails were delicious (bit strong| but can't complain about that). In terms of service| Jay was a standout at L'Oasis and Dave was 'the man' at the Italian restaurant. Dave even gave us a private showing of the hotel's wine collection. The little complimentary extras| like snacks that accompany drinks at the bar| added much to the feeling of being pampered. Allan in particular gave exceptional service at The Deck. Rooms were large and comfortable with both indoor and outdoor showers. Watersports were well managed and the selection of activities on offer was impressive. That being said Jeovanni at the boathouse needs work on his friendly game. The rest of the team is super nice with young Lohan being the most helpful and cheerful. The Beach is beautiful and the hotel actually removes coral from the beaches early in the mornings. One thing that should be mentioned is that the lagoon can become| at times| way too busy. Most of the dangerous traffic actually comes from boats not affiliated with the hotel. When we went sailing on the Hobie Cat| for example| it we had to shout at some of the other boat operators just to get them to take notice of us and give us space to beach the CAT. Other activities on offer are impressive like a couple of tennis courts| beautiful spa| SCUBA school and a ultra modern gym. This resort was without a doubt the perfect destination for our family holiday.,Mossel Bay| South Africa,21-07-17,Yes,5
Heavenly resort!,Our family of four just recently returned from a divine holiday of 12 nights at this fabulous resort. This was our 8th trip to Mauritius and we have stayed at several different resorts over the years. This resort was fantastic in addressing each member of the family's holiday requirements.My husband spent his time relaxing at the pool with a good book and sipping on copious quantities of coffee. My son (17 years old) slotted into the Teen Club and had the holiday of a lifetime.We hardly saw him - he only joined us for breakfast and dinner. I need to mention a few of the Teen Club staff by name as they were pivotal in providing him with the best holiday of his life. Kabz (number one)| Fabrice| Ludovic| Fabian and Janice. Oh wow...thank you guys. You were amazing. I don't know where you get your energy from. You kept the group of international teens busy from 11am to midnight for nearly two weeks.Scott will never forget you all! You were exceptional. My daughter (19 years old) and I used the pool as our base but spent many hours snorkeling| swimming| doing aqua gym| cycling and visiting the spa. The facilities at this hotel are top notch and everything works and is in good condition. One of the best hotel gyms that I have ever seen/ used. The spa is gorgeous| tranquil and relaxing. The beach is quite narrow but is long and well equipped with shade and loungers. The beach is beautiful for running on and the swimming area has been fairly well cleared. I swam almost every day. The sea was glorious. We were upgraded to a 3 bedroom villa. Pure luxury. We were well looked after by Rama and he was a gracious host! The restaurants are fabulous. Our favourite was the Indian. They have a marvelous santoor player. He was great and I was super impressed by his willingness to get the little kids involved with his act. Great service too from Pazal and Daby.Don't hesitate - book now. You will have a fabulous holiday. This resort caters for all ages and tastes. We will definitely be back.,Pietermaritzburg| South Africa,20-07-17,Yes,5
Fantastic location| get sunsets. Beautiful beach.,"We Stayed in July and this is a big busy hotel. You have to suffer the old""towels on the sun loungers at dawn"". You have to pick with of the 6 restaurants to eat in. But need to do days in advance to get your choice and a time that isn't 9pm. Food is very expensive. Rooms are great modern and a great size. The people at the water sports could take more care of those out on their equipment my children got into difficulty and no one helped and the next day a dad was complaining to the water sports guy he had had to rescue his son who was in trouble. They seem to just hang around looking cool there and don't watch the water at all. On a snorkel trip with a rip the guy sat on his phone didn't really keep an eye on the 6 of us in the water. ",Auckland Central| New Zealand,19-07-17,Yes,4
5* resort with a 5* price tag,The Trou aux Biches resort is a delightful place. The grounds are extensive| the beaches are clean and close| the facilities on the whole are excellent.Once you accept the costs for your stay (for example Room or Room + Breakfast) you have to swallow hard before forking out for meals. This is the thing that marked it down for me.Minibars with water and snacks at 5 times the cost of buying these locally; buffet dinner ex-drinks for MUR 2000 (GBP 45); a la carte is more (with many meals subject to a supplement| even if you've paid for all inclusive).Water sports were underused by us but very popular. Sailing| snorkeling| kayaking| pedalos| windsurfing and paddle boarding. All good| even if you couldn't go far.Diving is available onsite with 2-3 dives a day dependent on your qualification. Again| MUR 700 more than the excellent Trou Aux Biches Beach dive center about 100m away along the beach. Go there instead| you'll thank me.So a lovely place| but determined to make the most of its western guests and their wallets.,Edinburgh,19-07-17,Yes,4
Total relaxation,This is an excellent hotel with friendly staff and a great location. It is rated as 5* in Mauritius.The beach is long and white and allows for strolls to the village.Sunsets are amazing.The room:We had a family room with our kids of 6 and 7. The kids had their own on suite bathroom unlike some of the resorts in Mauritius where children share with parents. The rooms are spacious with all you would expect. The quality of the linen was good but the mattress was to soft for our liking.The minibar has no milk if you prefer that above creamer.The room was at the back of the resort and the constant traffic of the resort carts was a bit of a nuisance early evening.Our room had a couple of fittings the were pulling out of the wall e.g. the hand shower fitting.Over all these observations are nit picking.The food was great.The service is a tad slow especially at the bars if you are trying to get a sun downer to enjoy on the beach. There is no all inclusive option and drinks are quite expensive.The crayfish evening was not worth the money although enjoyable.We had a great time and wouldn't mind going back soon.,Pretoria| South Africa,18-07-17,Yes,5
Paradise for all the family ,Enjoying a wonderful holiday here with our three children (who usually bore very easily on a beach holiday)... The grounds are stunning and well looked after. Pools gorgeous and beach is beautiful. The employees are all very polite and helpful and hardworking. Food is really very good for a big hotel especially the Thai| Indian and Italian.Lots of water sports included and you can kayak or paddle board to your hearts content (as long as there are some free). Again the boat house guys are helpful and very kind to the children. Children played table tennis and tennis to keep themselves amused.The hawkers on the beach are a little irritating but a firm polite 'no thank you' seems to work if you're not interested. Like every large hotel I have been to the age old problem of people dashing to put towels on sun loungers exists here too but not yet found a hotel that can really prevent it. As it happens the best place to sit and swim on the beach is at the far end of the resort by the boat house and pier and there's much more space and better sand (less coral) up there anyway! Our older two children drifted in and out of the teen club a few times and said it was okay and the guys who ran it were friendly. Gym is well equipped and some of the afternoon classes are very good too... depending on the instructor. Would highly recommend overall. ,Thames Ditton| United Kingdom,18-07-17,Yes,5
Trou aux Biches is Number one,"We went to Trou aux Biches on the 22 June 2017| to go celebrate our 40 years wedding anniversary. What a good choice we made. Beachcomber Tours has an anniversary package| on arrival we got a gift of champagne| fruit plate and beautiful Mauritius prints plus we got free lunches for our entire stay. On our anniversary night they made it so special| for pudding we got this special cake with huge sparkle and 2 musicians signing ""celebrations"". Thank you Trou aux Biches you made our 40th anniversary very special and we will never forget it| we will be back for our 45th",Modderfontein| South Africa,18-07-17,Yes,5

Pure heaven!,If i would write all the nice and good things about this resort it would take forever! Its just incredible| from the staff to the rooms to the food| just perfect.We went on a 10 days family vacation and boy was it nice! Would come back anytime.Spacious rooms| very clean. They would come and clean/refresh twice a day.Big variety of restaurants and foods| fresh fruits| sweets etc. Different themes every night for dinner.The coconut confiture is delicious! ( u can only get it at breakfast ) Very nice and clean beach even tough all the beaches in Mauritius are public.Lots of activities| some included in the hotel like paddle board| kayak| wind surf. Water sport and tubes are extra if i remember right.There is really nothing i can think off which was not ok at this resort.I highly recommend it!,Durban| South Africa,11-07-17,Yes,5
Beautiful hotel with the best beaches. Friendly staff and delicious food.,We stayed in a Villa room with direct access to the beach and a private little pool. The best hotel room we have stayed in by far. This was our third trip to Mauritius and will go back in a heartbeat.,Durban| South Africa,11-07-17,Yes,5
Happy,During the stay in the hotel| I feel very happy| the hotel's services| scenery| water sports| and so on are quite good| I was impressed| it is worth every tour to Mauritius people choose to stay. The next time I travel to Mauritius| I'll choose Trou| aux| Biches| Beachcomber| Golf| Resort & Spa.,London| United Kingdom,10-07-17,Yes,5
3 star hotel with 5 star prices ,We were so disappointed by this hotel that we ended up checking out early and moving to another hotel. This hotel is so busy but yet feels soulless and uncared-for. The prices for everything from the rooms to the food/drink to the spa are extortionate but the quality is so poor that you just feel ripped off. A few positives:* The beach is lovely but busy (a lot of hawkers and people selling tours).* The staff are sweet and kind.* Tennis courts and sports centre are great.* Gardens are stunning.And the rest:* The food is TERRIBLE and so overpriced. One lunchtime I had a £18 tuna salad with 3 small cubes of tuna and some old lettuce. After a shocking dinner experience at The Deck (fish advertised as fresh fish of the day was overcooked and definitely not fresh!)| we opted for room service the next evening. My husband had a burger and I had soup with a side of vegetables (meant to be roasted but were boiled to within an inch of their lives) and the total was about £60. Breakfast is mass catering at its worst - nothing is fresh other than the fruit and the coffee tastes like instant. * The rooms are huge but soulless and everything feels a bit tired and cheap (other than the mini bar where you can get a Kit Kat for £4 and a coke for the same price). There is no good coffee or herbal tea or fresh milk in the room (something you would expect for £250 a night). Although the housekeeping staff were sweet| there were countless knocks on our door for different things (cleaning| mini bar re-stock| turndown etc.) at such random times| we ended up putting do not disturb on our door for the whole day/night. * The spa is nice but stupidly expensive for what you get| again you just feel ripped off. The cheapest massage is almost £100. The music choice is questionable too - not sure opera followed by some rock/metal is appropriate for a relaxing massage. * Furniture/crockery etc. looks worn and old. There are plenty of broken/ripped sunloungers| chipped crockery in the breakfast buffet| stained sofas in the bar area.* Not an eco friendly resort! Their use of plastic is insane. For a hotel which claims to care about the environment| plastic usage is insane. Every room gets a non-reusable plastic water bottle everyday (other hotels we stayed at re-filled glass ones with filtered water)| food is covered in plastic wrap at the buffet and room service| plastic bottles of soft drinks in the bar/mini bar| disposable plastic cups at the bar etc. * Not for couples| especially honeymooners! The resort is huge| noisey and very unromantic (it's marketing blurb could not be more wrong).We have stayed at many hotels all over the world from small| inexpensive guesthouses to 5 star hotels. This is one of the worst places in which we have stayed with respect to value for money - 3 star hotel with 5 star prices. If we had been paying £80-100 per night| we probably wouldn't be so annoyed but this place is just a horrible rip off. ,London| United Kingdom,10-07-17,Yes,2
The best hotel in Mauritius !!!,We stayed at the Trou aux Biches (Beachcomber Resort) and had the most amazing time. Everything from the rooms (Villa)| butler service| villa management| and food and beverage management| to the location and scenery exceeded our expectations. Our two weeks stay involved water sport activities| included in the price| discovering the 6 different delicious restaurants| incredible massages and facials| and meeting the most wonderful staff members. Lancley was the best Butler we could have hoped for| always with a smile on his face| wonderful Prateema arranged our culinary experiences| not only at the hotel| but also in the city| Reena brightened our days by making sure we had everything we had wished for| and Dilany wonderfully checked up on us on a regular basis. Thanks to Jean Pascal we left with the most delicious chocolate cake recipe| and last but not least| a big thank you to Fatima| who helped us during an unexpected hospital stay. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone| who is looking for the most exceptional service at an exceptional resort. We are looking forward to a next time! ,Hamburg,09-07-17,Yes,5
A slice of paradise in Mauritius ,Trou aux Biches Beachcomber resort in the district of Pamplemousses is possibly one of the best in Mauritius. Set amidst lush greenery and well-manicured gardens| the place is truly perfect for an uber-relaxing and/or romantic getaway. While my bungalow is part of the 4-unit cluster| its design allows total privacy. I had my own outdoor jacuzzi and an outdoor shower is attached to the indoor bathroom that has an oversized jacuzzi. Facing west| the bungalow offers majestic sunset view while the gentle breeze lulls one into a vegetative state. Entertainment is available for kids and adults while the resort's 6 restaurants will surely fire one's gourmet imagination. Sports facilities and spa are likewise available. I did not try the golf course though due to the nature of my trip. I will surely go back in the near future!,Makati| Philippines,08-07-17,Yes,5
GREAT HOLIDAY,We and our 10 year old grandson stayed at this fantastic hotel mid June and can only say that we had a wonderful stay. Everything was perfect: beach| hotel premises| room| restaurants| boat house| swimming pools (even if a bit cold for this period of the year).My family and I would like to thank Mrs Fatima and all her staff that have taken care of us when my husband had a health problem. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world but have never meet persons like Mrs Fatima and her staff thank you very much. Should we return to Mauritius be certain that we will stay at the Trou aux Biches.,brescia,04-07-17,Yes,5

Location is fantastic!,Here is how I would split this review - Location - 5 starsBeautiful location! The beach is beautiful but cannot stay/walk in water as there are sharp rocks at the bottom which will hurt your feet.Food - 3 stars Mainly because water IS NOT included in the half or full board.Full board should include water too. We had to buy pricey bottle water at lunch and dinner every day. Why should water be at such a premium?? We asked for regular water but were told there is none and we have to buy bottles. Even in the room| we were provided 1 bottle per day. How is that enough for a family? Food in buffets is good. We can eat as much as we want. For us the La caravelle dinner experience was bad. Small portions of food. Was not filling. Slow service. The Indian restaurant is very good but service very slow. I would suggest stick to the buffets but there are days when the buffet is closed so we are forced to eat a la carte at other restaurants and did not enjoy that.Tropical Junior Suite - 4 starsThe suite was really good. Huge and comfortable. Love the outdoor shower!Overall| the resort is really nice. The smaller pools are heated. Just ask for it. Just the food experience turned out to be expensive in spite of full board as we had to purchase quite a few bottled waters every time. I would advice purchasing water bottles from a convenience store outside the resort and bringing them to the lunch/dinner tables.Special shout out to the boathouse staff. They did their best to accomodate requests without hovering around for tips. Very professional wonderful staff at the boathouse. We went on glass bottom tour| snorkeling. Other staff were also courteous but there is this constant expectation of tips which got a bit annoying. Beware of ever scheduling the cab cart. If you ask for it to go around the resort| you will get charged for it. Every bit adds up. So although we pre-paid| we left with a rather large bill.,Austin| Texas,30-06-17,Yes,3
Great location ,It took us a few days to warm up to the hotel we were a bit disappointed that the child minding rules were strictly enforced min age of 3. There was a compromise reached M-F 1300-1600 soctgat allowed us to get some parent time. The hotel is well maintained| the grounds| the rooms and all the sports equipment were of good quality. Hotel staff ranged from disinterested to excellent more excellent than otherwise. The kids club member Mia was wonderful with our 2 and 3 yo. Robert| part of the beach staff| was excellent. The quality of the food remained consistently high and we never had a bad meal. Staff managed some special things for the kids that made breakfast easier. The beaches are cleaned every morning. I was impressed with the visibility of the water which enabled us to see dolphins swimming past us. Unique to hear the pod well in advance of them coming past. Once we worked it all out we enjoyed the location and the hotel. We have already discussed coming back. ,Abu Dhabi| United Arab Emirates,30-06-17,Yes,4
Experience of Luxury and very personalized service,Our stay was from 23rd of June to 27th June| and we had booked 3 bedroom villa at the property. The amenities and the overall facilities in the villa were excellent and very private and cozy place exactly how we wanted our accomodation to be. We are family of 6 with kids of 23 and 14 and mother 72 years of age| so initially I was bit worried about each ones liking and choice| but I think the place was ideal and liked by all. Three bedroom villas are with decent sized living room| three bedrooms a full fledge kitchen with all amenities| and a private pool. We had a private butler too| her name was Rajnee| very sweet and she pampered us with her lovely smile and service during our whole stay. Our whole family loves Indian food and that's always a point I make sure that at least one time we get to eat at any Indian restaurant. The hotel has lovely Indian restaurant by the name of Mahiya| we had booked half board at the resort and the meals at the reastaurant had a set dinner menu. Although it was preset we could always speak to the Chef and rearrange our choice of menu and the service staff provided at the restaurant by all of them was really unbelievable. I am unable to remember the names Raj was one of them| but honestly all of them from staff who served to the manager and the CHEF| who was ready to cook anything of our choice... only thing missing was a good sweet dish... but it's absolutely fine.We were also pampered by the service manager Prathima who would always come in every morning to ensure that everything was fine and absolutely whatever we asked for from things we forgot to pack during our holiday to setting up reastaurant appointments and any local guidance required. Thank you for all your efforts to make our stay memorable. Above all the other hotel staff always smiling and ready to help at any given time. Also not to forget villa manager Reema who would pop in from time to time to ensure our stay was comfortable.The hotel has six reasturants Thai| Italian | French| seafood| international and Indian. All have good ambience and very courteous staff. It also has a private beach with lot of water sports available free for hotel guests. The spa| tennis court| Gym| teen and children club are other facilities available.We had also opted for breakfast to be served at our villa instead of Buffet breakfast available at the reastaurant as we we wanted to have it little late. Our personal butler would arrange a table by the poolside every morning at our own time we preferred in the morning. This was our second stay the same resort| last stay was in 2002| although the resort is renovated completely and facilities are equally good or better what has not changed is the attitude of staff| who are always courteous| helpful and smiling....it's the people which makes lot of difference| and that's what we experienced and a big thank you Beachcomber for making our stay memorable...,Dubai,30-06-17,Yes,4
Absolute PARADISE,This place is amazing and a must for everyone t try out. Couples| people with kids| big groups... If anyone finds major fault at this resort| there's something wrong with the individual and not the resort.Only slightly negative thing I can comment on is the lack of nightlife. A club vibe with people dancing would be amazing. There was music most nights though| but guests not dancing. Maybe the staff off duty in the evening should party with the guest?But still. I will give everything to go back to this amazing| friendly| luxurious paradise of a resort.,Port Elizabeth| South Africa,29-06-17,Yes,5
Wedding vacation,We cheched in at this hotel for 10 days for our wedding.The hotel/resort is beautiful and very clean| nice restaurants and good food. Polite employes and a beautiful beach.I dont give full score because it's very expensive and for that price we paid i expect exellency and despite polite and smiling service they were very| very slow.. all in all a very nice place to visit.,Johannesburg| South Africa,29-06-17,Yes,4
Mauritius Winter!,I have visited for two consecutives years. Last yr I went in august| this yr I was there in june. Firstly stunning| incredible resort. Splendind views(see photos). The hotel staff are fantastic. (Bernito| my favourite bar man!) Since I have been there more than once| I stayed on a sea facing penthouse. The ideal unit is an upstairs villa with stairs leading to the sea sand. They usually bigger than the down stairs unit( one upstair villa sits above 2 groundfloor units) The outside room showers were heavenly. The gym is great| modern machines towels an water provided. The themed restuarants| i preffered the indian restaurant food was great.The weather great| an occasional 10 minute heavy down pour of rain every 2nd day. So its hardly an issue but be weary should you book a cruise or a catamaran tht the weather is ideal. The venue has alot of history an wonderful family holiday memories. The kids will love it| the pools have shallow areas. I cant wait to take my kids there. HAPPY TRAVELLING!!,Johannesburg| South Africa,28-06-17,Yes,5
Best hotel ever!,I came with my parents & sister for 10 days and I had the most relaxing time! The breakfast is amazing| everything you want is there. Plus| you get a couple of the international daily news in your language at the entrance of the breakfast. Also| the team is really nice| whether it's in the restaurant or around the pool.Concerning the activities| you have a lot of them offered by the hotel| whether you want to go water skiing or wakeboarding.,Lincoln| England| United Kingdom,20-06-17,Yes,5
Great resort for family and friends ,Having stayed in a 3 bedroom villa we were utterly spoilt - this was a once in a lifetime trip and was planned to perfection by Seyexclusive. The villa was wonderful (the private pool very cold though!). The resort offers a great choice of places to eat for both lunch and evening meals. | restaurant reservations around the hotel were made on a day by day basis to make the most of the choices. This was a very very well run resort was complimented by the planning offered by my agent at Seyexclusive. ,Lincoln| England| United Kingdom,19-06-17,Yes,5
We loved this resort!!! The best for water sports!,The architecture and design of this resort is absolutely spectacular - the paradise.Our honeymoon suite was huge and super beautiful. The bathroom/shower design is the best part! All staff members are very welcoming and helpful. We stayed in 2 other resorts in different parts of the island| and this one is definitely the best one for water sports| not only because of the variety of water activities available included in your stay| but also because the boat house team is the most helpful!! Out special thanks to the boat house team! We lost our GoPro during water sky and they volunteered to help finding it after their working hours. First with the glass boat| and then with two snorkelers. And they found it! :D Breakfast is super here!,London| United Kingdom,18-06-17,Yes,5
A disappointig hotel,"As the Lux hotel we were due to use was unfortunately closed due to refurbishment| our Saga tour group of 19 stayed at the Beachcomber. Unfortunately| the hotel appeared to be not aware that Saga was a travel company and treated us as some sort of ""club"". Upon arrival| we were given sheets telling us were we could dine| at what times and how many courses we could have at meal times! This did NOT go down well!Needless to say| after the first meal after arrival| no one took any notice! The next thorn in the flesh was when we all found that our minibars were all cleaned out (bar the basics) presumably on instructions of the management. As if we could not afford to buy our own drinks. Just who did they think we were!The staff| bar one or two| were were treated with indifference| who it appeared did not want to be bothered with the likes of us. Hotel management take note| this cannot be tolerated in a so called 5* hotel.Food| on the whole was very| very good| with the Thai restaurant quite exceptional. Full marks there. The Italian restaurant was a disappointment | my wife had lasagne| as did two others| and were were all I'll afterwards. Draw your conclusions.Rooms| however| were the redeamers| really comfortable.So| would I return for another visit - no| there are better hotels to choose from!",North Yorkshire,17-06-17,Yes,3
Totally excellent,Overall it is difficult to fault this very large resort. There were 500 guests and 800 staff when we were there but it never seemed crowded. It may not have been full but there is so much space throughout the resort that I don’t believe it is ever really crowded. Overall we thought the resort was superbly run with well trained staff who were always keen to please and the extensive gardens and grounds were all immaculate. The staff were desperate if there was a hint of a complaint and leapt to correct anything if you so much as made half a complaint. All thanks to the manager Fatima who seems to appear in every part of the resort checking that all is running smoothlyThe individual thatched lodges each appear to contain 3 suites| each with their own private balcony and are well separated from the next lodges. We were booked into a junior suite on half board but were immediately upgraded and put onto a full board basis – fantastic! Our room was enormous| the bed was enormous and the bathroom was very spacious with large bath| quite excellent shower and 2 wash basins. A sliding door led to an outside shower – excellent for very hot periods I imagine but we only used this once. The WC is separate. The room was kept very clean and sheets and towels were changed regularly. Our only grumble was the lighting which could have been brighter but the individual bedside reading lights were excellent.The pure sand beach front is about 800 metres long with masses of beach loungers| thatched shelters with tables and masses of good palm trees for shade although the afternoon sun is from the west over the sea so you have to move your lounger back up the sloping sand for a lot of the beach. However we discovered that at the north end and beyond the boathouse there is a much wider and flatter beach which we much preferred and still with plenty of palm trees for shelter.Swimming in the sea was good with roped off areas to keep swimmers clear of passing boats but not a lot of rocks or snorkelling off the beach unless you swim out 300m or so and into the boating area. However if you want to go snorkelling there are free trips out in an open boat 3 times a day 10.00am. 2.30 And 3.30. It can take 15 minutes to get to the site – outside the reef and then you have 35 minutes or so to snorkel. This can be excellent but depends on the height of the tide – high tide is clearer and the amount of sea swell on which depends how close to the reef they let you swim. If the sea is rough they take you inside the reef which can also be very good. The staff at the boat house were very helpful and well trained and all equipment was immaculate and clean. You have to book your snorkel trips in advance as the boat only holds 12. There are also glass bottom boat trips| water skiing| sailing and all manner of paddling.There is one main swimming pool – very large with shallow sections for kids. Very well kept and clean and with masses of loungers around it. There are also about 6 smaller pools set back from the sea to serve each group of villas.Restaurants – we were very well fed for the whole week. There is one main restaurant – L’Oasis which is buffet service for dinner or breakfast. A good choice of food| some better than others but if you choose carefully you can eat very well here with a few exotic items on occasions. We much preferred the French restaurant – La Caravelle which is about 400m along from the centre but only 200m from our villa. Service at dinner here was usually excellent| there is a good choice of dishes many of which were delicious and some tasteful music from a pianist or singer in the background. We enjoyed this for breakfast and dinner and occasional lunches. The tables are well spaced out and it overlooks the sea. There are 3 other dinner restaurants – Blue Ginger is Thai food – a fixed menu but excellent food and good service but if you ask for medium hot you may end up gasping for breath and cold water – Mahiya is Indian and again a fixed menu with tasty food but the attentive service at the start rather faded later – Il Corallo is Italian| a la carte food some of which was excellent and the service was good but for us it was not as good as the French or Thai restaurants. There is also a lunch restaurant by the main pool and sea – Le Deck – always very busy| excellent food and service and ambiance but not as relaxed as La Caravelle.Trips out – a catamaran trip to Isle Gabrielle. We had done the same trip 2 years before when the weather and snorkelling and whole trip were superb. This time there was good sized sea-swell so the 1.5 hour trip to the island was a bit rougher with water spraying us all on occasions and the snorkelling was good in a sheltered bay but not nearly as good as before because the tide was up which meant that the current was very strong in the adjoining area which had been so good before. A good lunch and plenty of fresh air so a good day out but so much better at low tide.,North Yorkshire,15-06-17,Yes,5
Magnificent!,Le Trou aux Biches Beachcomber is perfect for families. There is everywhere and always something beautiful to please the eyes: the gigantic but elegant pool| the lovingly manicured gardens| the numerous beautiful water features that reflect the sky... The live performance of artists during dinners is highly appreciated. The performance of the Clarisse Sisters on Sunday evening came as quite an excellent surprise| waow! We enjoyed a true gourmet experience in La Caravelle and Il Corallo. In L'Oasis everything served in the lovely buffet was delicious as well as in the Desk with its simple but tasty dishes. (an absolute must try is the crab/coconut salad served in half a coconut| great!). ,north wales,13-06-17,Yes,5
Wonderful hospitality,I can't remember the last time I felt sad when I had to go home from a vacation but this time I did. I wish I could stay longer. The reason is simple| Beachcomber simply grew on me and made me feel at home. It had most breath taking view| sunsets| sunrises| and sky full of stars. The villas are clean and private. It was excellent food- with great variety. Our favourite was Mauritian night. Many restaurants to choose from for lunch and dinner. The icing on the cake was the friendly staff and their high level of service. They are friendly and everywhere we go there's always friendly smiles and small talks with the staffs. They made us feel like we are with family. The staff did not only walk that extra miles to fulfil our wishes| it was as if the staff took pride in doing so and they were truly happy every time they succeed. Which they did most of the time. Thank you specially to Miss Christabelle and all the staff of Beachcomber for making our stay such a wonderful experience. We left Mauritius with beautiful memories,north wales,12-06-17,Yes,5
Good but could be great,Even though I've only given the TAB 4 stars| let me caveat that by saying we had an absolutely wonderful fortnight overall in Mauritius at this lovely hotel.We stayed in a family suite which had an additional bedroom and bathroom for the kids. The room was fabulous- spacious| spotless and functional. The outside shower was an unexpected bonus! The service was great - this is a large hotel so you're never going to experience the attentiveness you get at somewhere like the Prince Maurice| but even so| the staff were warm| smiley| accommodating and professional. The food and service at the a la carte restaurants was absolutely fantastic. Our favourite was the Indian and the Italian - just perfect! Special mention must go to Dave| who runs the Italian restaurant - he's an absolute star who made an already lovely experience into a fabulous one! We were on the escape package| which| having seen the price of lunch and drinks| is definitely worth it! In addition to dinner| an a la carte lunch at two restaurants is included| as are certain drinks| including very good white and rose wines. There is a decent enough but limited drinks package too| it was fine for us but I think the hotel could perhaps expand the cocktails available - it only offers one| being basically rum and juice.The grounds| the main pool and the beach are both stunning| and the pool service is great. Thank you Rajesh for being so patient with us and our Phoenix requests!! My worry though is that there's nowhere near enough sun loungers to cope in high season. We went in May| which is low season and all the beds were occupied by mid morning. Similarly on the beach - I can just imagine hoards of disgruntled sun seekers waiting to pounce on an empty space! And on the subject of loungers - whilst the ones at the beach are really comfortable| the ones round the pool need a serious rethink! They are really the most uncomfortable loungers I've ever encountered at this standard of hotel!A couple of other niggles too - the overall breakfast experience needs to be improved. Whilst the waiters were generally lovely| the servers were pretty grumpy - no smiling and at 10am sharp| which is when the breakfast buffet closes| food gets cleared away quickly| despite there being a good numbers of people left still eating! The coffee is awful too - I'm usually a big fan but I reverted to juice at breakfast and then headed to the bar afterwards for a much better cappuccino!I'm not sure what was going on with the mosquitoes when we were there - we traveled to Mauritius in October last year and weren't bitten once| but this time| my poor husband| who has NEVER before been bitten| despite traveling extensively| was eaten alive! I know this isn't the hotel's fault but they only fogged once in two weeks - given the extent of bites I saw on a number of people| this process should have happened more frequently.Still| overall this was a fabulous holiday at a beautiful hotel| and I would certainly return| albeit only on the escape package! ,north wales,09-06-17,Yes,4
Great holiday in Mauritius,Excellent resort and amazing setting ! Troux aux biches hotel is by far one of the best resorts and settings on the whole island! Rooms and service are amazing| food and drink is excellent| the beach setting with loungers / pool etc is better than anything we have experienced before in Mauritius.,Cape Town| South Africa,09-06-17,Yes,5
Good Management Averted A Bad Incident,What could have been a major disaster for the hotel was saved by the Assistant General Manager Fatima and the Food and Beverage Manager Jerome.After a horrifying dinner episode| because my son was wearing a pair of bermuda shorts to dinner| we left the restaurant in disgust. We were met by the Assistant General Manager Fatima. She is fantastic. She asked how she could sort the problem out. My wife was so annoyed she didn't want any sorting out. Fatima arranged for complimentary room service dinner go be sent to our unit.The next morning both Fatima and the Food and Beverage Manager Jerome came to apologise and they said that the situation was handled totally incorrectly by the person who called himself the food and beverage manager.Anyhow| to cut a long story short| The two managers took my wife breakfast on the beach. The Hotel's General Manager also came to apologise for an unacceptable situation. Fatima then arranged with my son without my wife knowing to come for complimentary valentine's dinner. She picked him up from his apartment herself and he surprised my wife.A pleasant evening was had on the beach and although the Assistant General Manager and the REAL Food and Beverage Manager sorted out the unpleasantness of the situation| the stupid rule of not wearing Shorts to dinner still exists. Even though woman can wear shorts| mini skirts| etc.It is a wonderful hotel with great rooms and good service| all just spoilt by an individual who had no idea how to handle sticky situations and by one stupid rule| which makes no sense in a holiday resort. This is a place where people come to rest| relax and enjoy their holiday and the prohibition on bermuda type short pants for dinner has no purpose or place in the resort and this rule should be totally abolished.,Pretoria| South Africa,05-06-17,Yes,4

5th Anneversary,This is a very nice resort in terms of appearance and really has one of the most beautiful beaches in the north. I have had better service and felt more spoiled at other hotels in Mauritius. The admin was a bit unorganized to my liking. The most off putting thing was probably the cost of drinks and the drinks included in the Escape Package. The drinks are extremely expensive. I paid 1400 rupees for a double Johnny Walker Black Label. In a tourist market 1 km away from the resort I saw a 1 liter Johnny Walker Black Label Double Black for 1580 rupees... There really isn't much included in the Escape package regarding drinks so for the 70 Euro / day you have to drink 12 beers to break even. With the process of waiters taking your order and you signing for drinks this could take the whole day. I would recommend this for people who are only interested in a very nice beach and good food (without wine).,Nelspruit| Mpumalanga| South Africa,29-05-17,Yes,3
Spoilt for a wonderful break relaxed and rested.,We were part of a business group that were entertained by the Spar Group South Africa| 250 people. The hotel did not stand back in the service they provided for such a large group.The facilities were superb and the beaches were magnificent| the gardens are excellently maintained and beautiful to walk through. When the long evenings have passed even early morning| 0200 the shuttle service from restaurant's is available and prompt.Breakfasts had a large selection of choices| with fresh choice of eggs and omelettes.The evening restaurants made a good selection of various choices with the Indian selection being excellent.Our room was more than comfortable with a large area bedroom and veranda that allowed us to relax and enjoy| bathroom space was huge and allowed every one to enjoy the morning showers and bath.Service at the Reception area was excellent and communication was great.An awesome week was spent at the hotel and we came back relaxed and rested.,Nelspruit| Mpumalanga| South Africa,29-05-17,Yes,5
Stunning,Our first time visiting Mauritius. The resort is absolutely beautiful. We had a tropical suite in section 4| there are all different sections with a swimming pool in the centre of each. The room is very roomy huge bed| comphy pillows. Bedroom opens onto lush gardens with your own private patio area. Huge shower and deep bath with seperate toilet and also an outside shower. The beach is right in your doorstep| and what a beach it is| stunning. Take a drink and sit on the deck chairs and watch the sunset| amazing. Our package included breakfast which was great and again the view is to die for. We didn't get the full board as the prices were extreme and drinks are very expensive. If your not a walker maybe think twice. They will pick you up with golf carts and taxis are readily available. Local buses are very frequent also. There are some lovely local restaurants close by which are a third of the price. If you want to have a holiday where you are totally relaxed this is it| no hassling from locals| very friendly people. Not a huge amount to do except lots of water sports. Not a great deal of shopping which suited us. We went in May /June weather beautiful| still a bit humid and a bit of rain| but very pleasant.,Perth| Australia,27-05-17,Yes,4
Super excellent hospitality ,We had one of the best holiday experience during our stay from 12-May to 19-May 17. We were 2 families of 4 members each| having taken up Family Suite. Right from d check in process| the experience was WOW. Having Vegetarian Jain Food requirement| we were initially apprehensive about availability of same. But it was a wonderful and pleasing experience to get d kind of attention from all d restaurant within d resort for meeting our special food requirement. We never imagined we would be able to have our meals at any restaurant other than d Indian restaurant| Mahiya. But due to d receptive behaviour of d staff| we were able to have meals suiting our need at La Deck| Blue Ginger| La Oasis and La Caravelle as well. Apart from this| overall| the whole stay was wonderful| resort facilities above par| everyday pool activities | event in evening etc just added in d experience. We would surely visit in coming future too.....,Gold Coast| Australia,25-05-17,Yes,5
Beautiful Suites front beach in this lovely huge hotel,Whenever you stay in a hotel you always wonder what the architects are doing and if they stay in the rooms they designed.. In that case.. the mauritian architect who did hotel DID.. the front suites bungalows are fantastic really spacious.. big dressing room huge bathroom with an inside shower and an outside shower.. a huge bathroom..wonderful tiles that are NOT slippery... for a change.. a beautiful terrace.. well really nice accommodation.. The F&B is not always on the level of the hotel part..( Caravelle for lunch |Buffet |Thai Restaurant is terrible | Deck Bar very hard to get a drink ) and that can be improved.. because Mauritians are such nice people.. it is a problem of management.. the other problem you have are the merchants bothering you on the beach and sometimes too many boats passing by. But all together for a great rest a honeymoon or a family stay. this hotel offers a great potential. the athmosphere is more friendly than the Dinarobin...where we went as well and the Suites and the Beach are far better.,Gold Coast| Australia,23-05-17,Yes,5
Mauritius Vacation,Great Hotel! very welcome staff! Everyone : Receptionists | Waiters| Managers| Hostesses| Cleaning staff| everyone very very very nice!!! we had nice big apartment with separate shower outside.plus where is a pool in each block| so it very comfortable.beach was always clean | always place to rest. Territory is huge and nice.we tried SPA after race and it was very nice too!We just dont like food at all| breakfast may be ok but the rest no| we dont understand how it is possible| that the ocean is so close and no nice sea food restaurants around... the choice is very rare ...,Gold Coast| Australia,23-05-17,Yes,5
Beautiful setting but our stay was disappointing,We stayed at Trou Aux Biches as part of our honeymoon. The grounds are beautiful| our room was a good size and the beach is beautiful. Having read previous reviews we knew that food and drink would be on the pricier side. I've no problem with this if the food and services matches these prices. Unfortunately we found the food to be far from the quality we expected. Our room wasn't very clean and the skirting was coming away from the walls in the bathroom. A couple of other issues arose and an apology was not offered. Overall our stay was disappointing and I felt the standards did not meet the five star standards we found in other resorts on the island.,Singapore| Singapore,23-05-17,Yes,2
Honeymoon ,What a great place to stay and relax| after our wedding - the restaurant are serving great food| the Italian & French restaurant being the absolutely best level of food| with a great variety & high quality for any taste that you can imagine.The leisure activities are great| canoe| paddle board| double canoe| Hobie Cats for sailing| snorting & Scuba is all part of the assortment included in package.There is always ways to improve and here we are talking service & waiting time in the restaurants| service could sometimes be more attentive and the waiting times are often very long - 40 minutes for. Desert is not ok.However: highly recommendable !!,Singapore| Singapore,22-05-17,Yes,5
A very good choice for lay by the beach holiday,"Quite big property by the beach - guess the beach front is circa 1 km from one end to the other -| very nicely preserved with rooms/villas scattered around green gardens| many rooms have a wonderful ocean view. Even the standard rooms are spacious| housekeeping if just fine. The sea is wonderful| you can enjoy some colorful fishes. You never feel overcrowded at the beach with many sunbeds scattered on the sand or under the trees right behind the beach| though the sunbeds around the main pool might feel more crowded with families with small kids. You can enjoy the sun set over the sea resting on the beach or with a drink at the bar near the main pool. Yes| the other comments are largely right| the food is a bit pricy given the its quality - the quality is just fine| nothing to worry (the Thai and the Italian were our favorites) but it is pretty much standard ""big hotel food""| not ""restaurant"" stuff. I would think one should expect laying by the beach with no hassle with the service or anything else and relaxing 24 hours a day from a holiday at Mauritius. Well| this is what this hotel offers. Of course spectular dining would be the top-up on such a holiday| well ok then you are warned| don't expect very much| so if you are after it| check out for some travel at the evenings for a fine dine as you would find nothing on that front in close by. Overall a very good experience for a relaxed beach holiday.",Europe,20-05-17,Yes,5
Good Hotel| But very overpriced,We stayed for 2 nights and glad we are moving on. The hotel and grounds are beautiful| the beach and sea too. The rooms are big and spacious. It is quite difficult trying to get around the resort. It's not signposted or labelled that well. The staff are friendly and helpful. We've stayed in 5 star hotels all the way through our honeymoon and this is in my opinion far from 5 star. Cockroaches in our room| a mouse running through the restaurant buffet area as we are getting food. The food and drink was at extortionate prices. For example €30 for 2 gins and a tonic water. We did research the hotel before we came here but didn't expect costs the high. When we complained about our experience in the hotel they staff didn't want to know. For me I'd never return here| it's overpriced and not 5 star in my opinion.,London| United Kingdom,19-05-17,Yes,1
The best resort on the island,I have travelled to Mauritius for over 45 years and have visited most of the resorts on the island. This has to be one of my favourites. As well as a fantastic beach and great restaurants the villa experience is extra special. As a busy mum with a large family| the villa option is one way that I actually get to have a holiday. The flexibility of the space and our own pool| meant that we could relax in our villa| organise food and drinks when we liked. The housekeeper organised breakfast at the villa in the morning and we were able to sit as a family without having to fight over a breakfast buffet. This was our second experience of doing this and I am about to book our next holiday here again.,London| United Kingdom,18-05-17,Yes,5
One of Maurutius Best Resorts,We only stayed at Trou aux Biches for two nights| but we had a great time. Staff is very friendly and the the food are great. If you like Thai food| please visit the Blue Ginger Restaurant| they are the best. With Trou aux Biches you get what you pay for| luxury. Thank you Fatima for always being the friendly face of Trou aux Biches| you made us feel like VIP guests.,Johannesburg| South Africa,18-05-17,Yes,5
Ideal place for holidaying,Great place for family holidays. Varieties of restaurants and excellent hospitality makes it as favourite one. All sorts of water sports and pool size to eAch makes this good choice for adventure and for kids.,Johannesburg| South Africa,17-05-17,Yes,5
Awesome experience,Great food| great service| great rooms| great setting. Close to some really nice restaurants and shops. Only negative was the pictures on the internet show fruit baskets in the rooms and these we missing.,Johannesburg| South Africa,17-05-17,Yes,5
Great hotel| but overpriced for the experience,The grounds| the room and en suite bathroom| the 'private' and the central pools| the location and the beach/setting are great. The snorkelling was really enjoyable and a pleasant surprise. The resort also has the other standard free water activities so we had casual fun on the paddle boats| kayaks etc. So it was all good and fine.However| at the very premium price point that you are paying| the service experience is just not good enough and left a bitter taste when we were reviewing our costs for the trip. Especially relative to the Sands| which is the other resort we stayed at during our trip. Our specific complaints included the following:- there were no bellboys to greet us upon arrival - we unloaded our own luggage and found and packed it on to our own trolley - not luxury service- on a couple of occasions in the,Johannesburg| South Africa,12-05-17,Yes,3
Great place to stay...but you definitely pay for it,The hotel is well laid out with exceptional rooms| many different swimming pools to relax in and it has all of the amenities you look for in a hotel. We also found all of the staff we encountered provided an exceptional level of service. The only fault I have with the hotel is the price of food and drinks. I must say that the dinners we had there were of high quality| and there are multiple restaurants to choose from| but the prices are quite a bit higher than what you would pay at home for the same. Regarding alcohol and drinks| I recommend you go to the store that is just a short walk away. You will pay only a fraction of the price there.Over all| I am really glad we chose this hotel. We had an amazing time and found it to be very relaxing....which is exactly what we needed. Just make sure you budget for the extras if you're planning to eat at the hotel.,Amsterdam| The Netherlands,11-05-17,Yes,4
Magical setting|but not quite up to speed....,Awesome views| stunning rooms| but unfortunately staff not equipped to deliver the service expected| and the food is shocking for a 5 five hotel| especially as there are several restaurants to chose from. Been visiting Mauritius for the last 12 years| and sorry to say | this was the most disappointing holiday.,Melbourne| Australia,07-05-17,Yes,5
A beautiful resort but comes at a cost ,My family including 2 children ages 7 and 4 spent 5 nights here last month. We stayed in a family suite and enjoyed our time but there are areas that could be improved. POSITIVES - The room itself was stunning| very quiet and the curtains made the room completely dark even if it was light outside - The gardens are beautiful and the gardeners do a great job with maintenance (the resort is huge so this wouldn't be easy!) - The boathouse and water activities - you can do water skiing| parasailing| paddle boarding| sailing on a small catamaran| glass bottom boat| snorkelling| etc. Big shout out to Nicholas who was fantastic! - The kids club is fantastic!! There were any activities to keep them occupied - they even have the opportunity to do water skiing! NEGATIVES - The cost of food!!!! I know this is a 5 star resort but the cost of food is outrageous! We spent time in another 5 star resort during our time and didn't experience prices like at Troux Aux Biches. We were late arriving and missed making a reservation at a restaurant - this was a blessing in disguise! We were advised that the only option available was the buffet which was 2000 rupees each for adults and 1000 rupees each for children. That's close to $240AUD for a buffet meal for the family plus drinks on top! We ended up going to the restaurants near the Police Station in Troux Aux Biches and experienced fantastic food! We did this each night during our 5 night stay. - The exorbitant cost of taxis...best to hail down a taxi from the front entrance! - Because the grounds are so big they rely on buggies. If you want to leave the resort they won't drive you to the front entrance| they'll only drive you half way and then you have to walk (this is hotel policy aka not going to encourage you to leave the resort!)- The staff are no warm and friendly with the exception of the boathouse staff. - There is no Mauritian feel to this resort - I could have been in any country. Very little Mauritian options on their menu and no snack trucks or vendors close by. We also didn't experience any sega or Mauritian shows (only on Tuesday nights which was the only day we weren't there) ,Melbourne| Australia,06-05-17,Yes,4
Unfriendly,Refused access at the entrance to the Hotel by the Gatekeeper who claimed the Hotel was full and therefore couldn't allow us in to have a drink. Accessing the Hotel via the beach proved they were lying...!!,London| United Kingdom,06-05-17,Yes,2
Beautiful setting. Inconsistent customer service,A lovely hotel set in beautiful gardens with a fantastic beach. The hotel has several restaurants. The Indian and International restaurant are fantastic. Definitely the best for me. The gym is good too with plenty of classes on offer to keep guests entertained.However| there is big room for improvement.- Customer service is hit and miss. Some staff were friendly and very helpful| others less so. I had the unpleasant experience of some porters trying to force a tip from me having dropped off my bags.- Breakfast is available in two different restaurants. The smaller restaurant is definitely better than the larger one. Too often| I found food in the larger restaurant to be unavailable or not frequently replenished. The selection could be better too. - I think the basic spa facilities should be available to all guests. The hotel is expensive and as such| is already exclusive enough. There’s no need to restrict use of the facilities to those having treatments.,London| United Kingdom,06-05-17,Yes,4
Tourist's Paradise,stayed for 5 days. Wonderful Hospitality| great location.Experience at the Beach was excellent. Food varieties caters to all. Indian do not feel that they are in other continent. one of the best destination for holiday. ,Faridabad| India,05-05-17,Yes,5
2 weeks in paradise,We (2 adults and 3 kids age 8| 6 and 2) stayed at this resort from 8.-23.April 2017. To describe our stay in just one word would be - AWESOME! The resort itself is set amidst lush tropical garden with the most beautiful plants| flowers and trees you can imagine. Our „home“ was a 3-bedroom-villa with butler service. The villa has everything you need and so much more like 2 outside showers plus an outside bathtub| a pool| a bbq station| 3 spacious indoor bathrooms… Our butler lady| Anusha| kept it meticulously clean. One of the biggest luxuries of having such a villa is that you could have your breakfast right there instead of going out standing in line to get your scrambled egg or omelette. And once again| every morning we had the most delicious breakfast prepared by Anusha. Almost everyday we headed for the big pool where the kids could have spent the whole day if we had let them… The almost white sandy beach with its clear blue water just invites you to go in… The restaurants are without exception very good. I guess it depends on your individual taste which one is most to your liking| we loved the Thai and la Caravelle. If you asked our kids| the could have eaten pizza all day long;-)… Speaking of dining| the best experience| though| was when we had bbq and Mauritian cooking at our villa. Kamlesh| the chef and once again Anusha (and in case of the Mauritian cooking night when there was a second lady cook present whose name unfortunately I don’t remember anymore) each time prepared a wonderful dinner for us. After dinner| almost every night| we headed for the bar at la Caravelle for a nightcap and almost every night there was some fine live music. The time flew by so fast and we felt so much at home that we rarely felt the need to leave the resort premises although the island is certainly worth exploring. We made a 1-day trip to the South to the La Vanille Nature Park. This was interesting not only for the kids but also for adults. You can walk among dozens and dozens of giant turtles| watch crocodiles being fed or just take a stroll in this tropical park… We have one or two small points where we feel there is still room for improvement. At peak times| especially around and during Easter the resort was fully booked and you could see this in relation to the pool and beach chair situation. There were simply not enough of them. At this point a BIG thanks to Dasmuth who almost every day made sure that we had our „spot“ with chairs and umbrella. The other thing which is worth noting is that there is no real cosy and laid-back kind of bar… Sure there is the main bar at the big pool| but you cannot really sit at the bar itself and it is not really that inviting to have a drink or glass of wine after dinner. Sure| almost every night they had live music and everything but it really doesn’t have an atmosphere… This might be something the management might think about in the long run…We owe the fact that this vacation was so great for us not only to this amazing island itself| but to its people outside and inside of the resort. As I already mentioned| Anusha| a real gem| extremely friendly| funny| always approachable| our kids loved her. Desmuth| the beach chair guy| Nobin| the villa superviser| Kamlesh| the cook| Prateema| the villa manager| Reena| the main lady villa superviser (I am positive that I got the titles wrong| sorry for that!) and all the other waiters| barkeepers and staff at the resort. If it was possible| we would give way more than „Two Thumbs Up“!!!,munich,02-05-17,Yes,5
Paradise,Probably the best hotel in Mauritius| went on honeymoon and was treated like royalty from the time we arrived until we left. Staff were absolutely amazing and always there to attend to your needs. I will definitely be back,Cape Town| South Africa,02-05-17,Yes,5
Just gets better...,We returned to Trou Aux Biches after having visited in 2015. Overall everything I wrote then I would say is the same with a few pluses and minuses. The food is even better (didn't think that would be possible)| the gardens are looking even more beautiful and well kept| the rooms were also wonderful (last time was a family suite| this time two tropical junior suites)| the staff are very friendly and try to please all the time| especially Jerome (manager?)| Toolsey| Ravi| Sudhir in the restaurant and Christine in housekeeping . So the minuses; having confirmed (booked in Nov 2016) that we wanted the children to be in the suite above ours| they were allocated the suite next door and above. This was rectified after we rather strongly insisted but was rather tiring to have to do after a long journey from the UK.The smaller swimming pools where the suites/rooms are all situated around had very tired loungers and umbrellas and were not attended or cleaned by staff at all - this seemed to be a grey area that the gardeners did the gardens (collecting every last dropped leaf)| the pool guys regulated the quality of the water but nobody actually did the terraces around the pool. This was disappointing as the smaller pool was much quieter and more tranquil place to sit and read and swim etc rather than the main pool which was always full and noisy. (to be expected as it was over the Easter holidays).The evening turndown service was a bit random. I would also agree that extras including bottled water were quite pricey. A morning stroll down to the local supermarket is worth it to buy drinks and water at a fraction of the price. I would still recommend Trou aux Biches to anyone wanting a relaxing and special holiday in the most wonderful setting. We will be returning again I'm sure.,Salisbury| United Kingdom,01-05-17,Yes,5
Great resort,Stayed at the beachfront villa on the northern end of resort. Views were epic and room was spacious and well designed. Down side for me was that on first day we had dirty brown water coming out of hot water tap. This was fixed after a second call to reception. Maintenance guy explained a pipe burst earlier allowing sand into pipe which needed to be washed out. Not ideal when you put a baby in the bath and brown water comes out. No apologies from anyone. Our side of resort was great as beach was wide and soft sand. Walking to other side (south of pool) I was surprised how narrow beach was. Sand also much harder there. Great location in Mauritius. Did a bit of driving around island and Trou Aux Bich is one of my favorite spots. The snorkeling is good and its close to many good restaurants. ,Johannesburg| South Africa,01-05-17,Yes,4
Fantastic holidays,We have just passed 9 days in this magnificent hotel. A couple with a little girl of 6. We completely loved the place. the hotel is beautiful and very well maintained. While the hotel was full I never felt it| there was always place to stay in the beach| pool| bars| etc.The water sports were a highlight| there were always something to do and someone always available to help us.The Kids club was also very good. It's not only a place for the kids to play| it's a full day of activities from 10h00 to 23h00 when you can chose what to attend. Everyday I read the activities to my daughter and let her chose what she wanted to do.To resume this place is fantastic| very few improvement points (could have better beer selections....) it's a place to surely comeback.,Luxembourg City| Luxembourg,01-05-17,Yes,5
Lovely hotel set in beautiful grounds| friendly excellent service but with pricey extras,Overall a fabulous hotel set over large manicured grounds with tons of amenities leaving you no need to leave the resort if you don't want to. I booked with my girlfriend for 9 nights half board in a Tropical Junior Suite. The room - very nice and spacious| massive comfortable bed and very large bathroom with 2 showers (1 outside) and a bath.The restaurants - 2 buffet breakfast restaurants with a large selection and variety of food to suit all. For dinner there is plenty of choice in cuisine (Thai| Indian| Italian| French| Grill and a buffet with a different theme each night). Overall the food was very nice but the Thai restaurant was definitely the best. Reservations were not difficult| when we arrived we booked a different restaurant for each night and when we did decide to change one on the day wasn't a problem. My only bad point is that there are several things on the menu's which aren't included and are supplements. Naturally in a 5* hotel you don't expect things to be cheap but I felt the supplement prices were far higher than they should have been considering it is a supplement (and you have already paid) and were very over priced especially considering most were for prawns which being on an Island you would expect to not be overly expensive. In terms of the wine they had a varied selection ranging in price from £25 - very expensive. The waiters are not particularly knowledgeable on the wine so stick to what you know. We didn't tend to eat lunch very much but out of everything I felt the lunch food was the worst on offer (at Le Deck) and the most over priced. Amenities - Plenty to do. Lots of water sports included and never had to wait to rent anything (Pedalo| Kayak| Wind Surfing| Paddle Board)| also the tennis courts are floodlit| good quality and the hotel provides rackets which helps keep luggage light. Plenty of other daily activities on offer for those that want to be active (Aqua aerobics| yoga| beach volley ball etc).Trips - We did a speed boat trip up the east coast of the island organised for us by a rep who sits daily in the hotel. Very nice full day trip and at £100 each seemed good value considering it included all drinks (alcohol as well)| a bbq sit down lunch| transport and the actual full day on the boat with snorkeling etc. Considering lunch for 2 in the hotel with a couple drinks would probably come out to a similar total I thought it good value. Also the trip itself was great. 1 downside for us was that there were a lot of kids at the hotel but probably slightly heightened considering it was Easter holidays. There are ways to avoid kids if you want to during the day| the main large pool is where most tend to be and considering there is a 2km stretch of beach and several other quieter smaller pools near the rooms you can have a quiet time. Overall a big thumbs up for a great hotel with friendly and attentive service and plenty of amenities. Maybe slightly pricey in certain places but to be expected in a 5* hotel in Mauritius.,Ascot| United Kingdom,26-04-17,Yes,4
Disappointment after disappointment,"Likes: 1. The campus is beautiful. One of the prettiest landscapes| considering both the beach front and flora & fauna on the grounds. 2. The Staff is nice. Doing their best. They have the will but lack the skill. Dislikes:1. Old hard mattress. After the 1st night I requested a mattress cover. Only to discover there were already 4 thin mattress covers on the mattress. The hardest bed I have tried to sleep on in a long| long time. 2. No expresso/cappuccino available. At breakfast the 1st day asked for an expresso. After 25 mins| breakfast over| I was brought a weak brewed coffee. 3. Wine service: the staff has no training in wine. The Wine menu does not offer a description of the wines. (Nothing| zero| nada.) So we asked for a Sommelier to guide us through the list. 25 mins later a good hearted guy showed up| who also knew nothing about the wines. 4. It was very hard to book in for tables to avoid the buffet dinner. 5. Discovery scuba: As advanced divers we are eager for our kids to try scuba. We thought Mauritius with the warm water & great visibility would be the perfect place. Talked with shop: Instructor said ""we just walk in"" and each person can go as shallow or deep as they want to go with a max of 3 Meters. I took this to mean that the group walked into the ocean. When I got there & discovered they were going in a boat| I suggested to instructor that perhaps the translation from French to English created the misunderstanding. His response was to mimic the ""giant stride"" (a diving term for stepping off the boat) and said ""I said ""walk in""."" Google the terms for yourself. I was charged 50% of the dive cost for each child even though we did not proceed. 6. The Spa setting is gorgeous & tranquil. One of the nicest settings I have encountered. However| the service is a bit lacking. They don't show you around the locker room or steam/sauna room- they just pointed me in the direction. It is for this reason that I discovered that my locker key opened all the lockers- not just the one assigned to me. The music during the services was very odd. Not spa/yoga type Omm music but jazz with sections that featured horns. Not relaxing. Too much oil. I had a facial after the massage and still needed a towel to wipe the extra oil off me prior to dressing. 7. Kids & Teens Club. We have a 13 & 12 y.o.. They are a bit shy so we hoped they would be able to stay together but the Teens club director said they could not accommodate a 12 y.o. While the kids club's kids were in the 6-10 y.o. range. So my kids did neither.",Ascot| United Kingdom,23-04-17,Yes,2
Quality in every aspect! Idyllic family holiday,"We have just returned from the most fantastic 9 day holiday with our family of 2 adults and 3 children (13| 12 & 8 years). I have to say| my husband and I could not fault anything! The food| service| entertainment| family suite| weather| staff - was second to none. Our middle daughter became proficient in skiing within a day thanks to Ashvee & Ricardo - two of the nicest guys who became like a big brother to her. Our youngest enjoyed the kids club - even snorkelling & skiing with the other children. Amazing to see little ones as young as 3 skiing! Nicholas and his team in the boathouse were excellent| very attentive and always on hand to help with any of the water sports which we used plenty of - including the kayaks| paddleboarding| skiing| snorkelling. The food - sensational. Our favourite was the Thai and Indian| however all the restaurants were excellent. The food as good as any top restaurant in Australia. The children were well catered for in all restaurants too. Even the buffets were excellent| in particular on Easter Sunday! What an incredible display of the skills the French pastry chefs can create! Being at the resort over Easter was another bonus| with a fantastic kids Easter egg hunt around the gardens| followed by a pool party. Easter Monday saw an awesome foam party in the pool - with pumping music - great fun for all! The beach is magnificent - as is the main pool. Make sure you get a chair early though as they are ""saved"" generally before breakfast. There are beach sellers who wander along the beach| however they are quite respectful| and leave you alone if you let them know you're not interested. The great thing is whether you prefer the beach or the pool| there is plenty of space. I understand the resort was full when we were there| however we felt as though it was actually quiet. We tended to use the crescent pool in the early evenings| and again - it was generally quiet. Wifi is accessible around most of the resort - including the beach! Our family suite was huge! Plenty of room for us all - and the highlight was the outdoor shower which we all used every night! A bit of a novelty was using the golf buggies to run us around| so the girls often asked to catch one back to our room after dinner. GM Fatima is lovely| and was amazing to have her appear most nights in the restaurants - say hello and to be greeted by name. Nothing is ever too much trouble - you feel so incredibly special and welcome. The nightly entertainment was great too. We particularly enjoyed the fire show on the beach| the Sega dancers and the Bollywood night. I did indulge at the Clarins spa - which was divine. Highly recommended - I came out feeling amazing and floating I was so relaxed. All in all| this holiday surpassed our high expectations. we are already planning our return and can not recommend Trou Aux Biches highly enough!",Perth| Australia,21-04-17,Yes,5
Recently got married at this resort,This hotel is| in my opinion| amazing. The rooms are brilliant| the staff are amazing and the facilities are perfect also. If you can get a beachfront suite with pool then I would definitely recommend this but either way I would come here again. As with any hotel the drinks etc are slightly more expensive but there are a couple of supermarkets nearby that you can get drinks for your room / balcony to keep the cost down if needed / not all inclusive. (some parts of the year they don't offer this). I would recommend a night / few drinks in Grand Baie and go to the Banana Beach bar for some live music. We took a day out| transport sorted by the hotel| and were taken to swim with Dolphins as well as being taken to lots of excellent view points and the La Vanille nature park which was amazing. This was in my opinion great value but make sure you ask what the total cost for car + dolphins is so there are no misunderstandings. This hotel though is well worth a stay - I would be amazed if you would be disappointed.,Coleshill| United Kingdom,21-04-17,Yes,5
Outstanding stay| Kids loved it | we loved it,Just back from Trou Aux Biches . First time we've taken the plunge and returned to the region with children and we weren't disappointed . I'll start with the few tiny niggles (nowhere's perfect ) . The service at the bar could be a bit random | the buffet packs out by 8pm ( we were obviously there at easter| so the hotel was full)| and the beach beds/towels could be better organized| but then so could we have . The reality is that as a family we aren't early risers on holiday | so it was never going to be an easy ask . Now the positives | of which there were many. The staff couldn't have been more helpful throughout our stay. we stayed in a 2 bed villa with pool and butler service . The room was fantastic and at the level I would expect from a 5* hotel . The Butler service was exceptional | and one of the things that absolutely made our holiday . Tanu looked after us from the moment we arrived | til the moment we left . From preparing feasts for breakfast on our terrace every morning | to sorting out our evening meals . The room was kept spotless by her and by the end of the holiday we had no idea how we would cope with-out her ... and the children adored her . there were genuinely teary eyes when we left . Other things to note .. go half board .. I expected the evening meal to be the buffet option | it wasn't . We could eat at any of the six restaurants | a BBQ and Mauritian meal at the villa(again | thank you Tanu) was included with just a service charge to pay on the last 2 options . Also the fact that someone called day 1 to sort a meal planner for you | and book the restaurants etc was so simple | but genius .It took the hassle out of booking and frankly decision making . fortunately Tanu would remind us every morning where we should be and when we should be there .Going back to the beach | water-sports were included canoes | paddle boards| pedalos| snorkeling trips to the reef ( book early | they're very popular) | water skiing | hobie cats etc .. plenty to be getting on with and keep the children occupied. We've previously stayed at the Oberoi | and le Prince Maurice in Mauritius | both fantastic hotels and we loved them | but both stays were pre kids | and we weren't sure that they would have been right for us this time .Value-wise | the room we had wasn't cheap | but for what we had | it was value. Lastly | thanks to Ian at Westaway travel | no idea if this is allowed on a review but I've not used a travel agent for over a decade| his brief was Antigua | he came back with Mauritius . He nailed it for us | many thanks,London| United Kingdom,20-04-17,Yes,5

Trou aux biches...noisy beaches don come here for peace and tranquillity!,A great resort but beware...it is not private beach and gets invaded by local teenagers. Thats ok as they were not aggressive but there were very noisy and ruined an otherwise tranquil and restful resort. The resort should highlight it is not a private resort and should not charge 5 star prices for beach services given it is open to the public. An otherwise woderful resort.,Gauting| Germany,17-04-17,Yes,4
A piece of paradise| where you want to return to ,"It was our second time at this resort. This time we stayed there with our 6 month old baby and it was a perfect holiday for us: the whole team (especially the team of ""Le Caravelle"") was so attentive; they made sure that we feel at home. We'll definitely come back... again! ",Vienna| Austria,14-04-17,Yes,5

Beautiful villa| excellent housekeeper!,We first visited TAB 9 years ago and it had been totally rebuilt since. We were delighted that it had not lost the character we loved on our first stay| with all 'rooms' spread out in bungalows throughout the lush gardens. With 3 children in tow this time we chose the 2 bed villa with private pool - it did not disappoint - beautiful rooms| large living area and beautiful small pool and garden. Best of all was Sangeeta| our personal housekeeper who prepared us a delicious breakfast in the villa every morning and kept the place spotless - she couldn't do enough for us| we wanted to bring her home!I have not given 5 stars as the service (other than Sangeeta) was not up to a luxury hotel at times - we had to ask for drinks several times in a couple of the restaurants| and slow service at times| if they got this right it would be a solid 5 stars,Nuremberg| Germany,11-04-17,Yes,4
Perfect and unforgettable Honeymoon,We have spent a perfect and unforgettable honeymoon at the Trou aux Biches Beachcomber Golf Resort & Spa Hotel.The employees of the hotel were all very nice| friendly and hospitable. The food in all restaurants was really delicious. The room (tropical suite) was very comfortable - we've liked the tropical outside shower :-).The atmosphere in the hotel was very relaxable and friendly.We've enjoyed being at the Trouble aux Biches Beachcomber Hotel for our honeymoon and can recommend staying there.,Nuremberg| Germany,10-04-17,Yes,5
Paradise,First trip to Mauritius and I'd love to go back. This hotel was beyond beautiful set amongst tropical gardens. The staff were always on hand| so helpful and very polite. Weather was beautiful| the beach too. I celebrated my 40th out there and wouldn't have wanted it any other way. Thank you trou aux biches,Bristol| United Kingdom,10-04-17,Yes,5
Truly Disappointing,"I think I had a few months to cool down over my last trip at TAB last June'16. This place has always been held up as one of the most luxurious hotels on the island and praise highly on their staff training program. We have stayed there previously but what a disappointment it has been on our last visit!!To begin with we checked in with 2 rooms. One room was not ready despite being early/mid afternoon| the other room had water from the A/C dripping/leaking on the floor. At the time of booking| we also specifically requested one with ground floor room as my dad has some limited mobility. Both rooms were on the upper floor and they simply said it was too late to change - we clearly saw many ground floor rooms empty around all afternoon and that evening! So with the leak| we had to repeatedly call reception over a period of more than 1 hour to query what they would do about it as we were just stuck in the room.... All we got was ""please bear with us we will call you back immediately"" ...No-one ever turned up so we had to make a trip to reception. We were told to all go back to that room with water on the floor and just wait there as they were all busy! They apparently had no availability for some reason - and the hotel was not even fully booked. Also it took 2.5 hours for them to bring our luggage (again after us chasing with numerous phonecalls) - so we were held hostage in that room with wet floor! Finally got our 2nd room allocated and a proper room swapped without leak early that evening. What a total waste of money for that night! Next day one of the 2 rooms was due to be upgraded to a 3 bed (which they fully knew about as it was made at the time of booking months prior). After an awful lot of faffing around| they said that that particular room would now need to be checked out first so we needed to wait for them to get back. Later that morning after breakfast| we came back to the other room which never require checking out and to our shock found all our personal belonging rammed packed randomly in our suitcases and stacked by the entrance door!!!! I mean| is this normal?? Are they even allowed to do that in Mauritius?????? Back we went to reception to sort it out. Another full morning gone by where nothing was sorted until past lunchtime! A total waste of time with various back and forth journeys to reception and frustration. Not a single apology again and still no sign of the hotel manager despite us requesting we see him on various occasions.Third day| we had other members of our family arriving and joining on separate hotel booking-4 new rooms. First TAB had not even acknowledged that booking on their internal system. Got held at the hotel gate and after more faffing and us contacting the tour operator| the new guests were finally let in. Of course none of the rooms were ready - another wait for 3 hours for everyone in that group and yes it was evening by the time they settled properly!!!!Wait it gets better....Day four| one of the new rooms had no water. Another trip to the reception desk - more time wasting with back and forth discussion and frustration from everyone. They could not even sort out this issue and they were not in a position to swap that room (bear in mind that the guests in that room were on their honeymoon!!!). Instead reception team simply told us to just wait until they send someone later that evening to inspect .....and hopefully fix. I mean this was beyond a joke now. Still no sign of the hotel manager (seems he or she is never on site when there are true issues to be sorted. His/Her front desk team obviously are either not proactive or simply do not have any authority to make any call. I suspect it is the latter).Checking out - they refused compensation of any kind. Of course the hotel manager or anyone senior enough to make a call was nowhere available. After numerous contact with the hotel following the trip| they finally offered us 1 room for 2 nights with various limitations (e.g. cannot be used during peak periods - so excluding December and Easter| half board only| only valid for 6months which means they expect us to book for another holiday to Mauritius during that time just to stay for 2 nights!). Bear in mind that in total we had booked 7 rooms including some family suites!During check out| I also witnessed another guest venting out her deep frustration at the reception desk. She was visiting her parents during lunchtime who were staying at the hotel and she simply wanted to pay for a meal so that bill does not get added onto her parent's room. Reception repeatedly told her this was not something they could do.Overall| TAB has totally ruined our family holidays - some were coming over to Mauritius for the first time and work in the hospitality industry thinking there could be potential to add some Beachcomber hotels on their luxury portfolio. What a shame and shortsightedness from TAB management team. We have been to TAB before without any hickups but never we have experienced such a disastrous stay at any hotels anywhere in the world. It is such a shame that the management does not seem to care.I doubt the Beachcomber headoffice are ever made aware of such disgraceful service.For future holiday planners out there| beware. If there is no issue during your stay then this place can be great. But anything simple for them to resolve might just be beyond their scope no matter no small it is. Staff in general on the other hand have always been very friendly but a smile can only go so far when everyday you encounter multiple small or big issues that they cannot resolve. On the plus side| the food and beverage team have gone above and beyond - this is the consistency one would expect throughout from such a luxury hotel resort commanding that kind of price.",London| United Kingdom,10-04-17,Yes,2
A memorable stay,Trou aux Biches is definitely one of my favorite hotels in Mauritius. The children always had something to do and were never bored. We had a relaxing and very memorable holiday and the resort itself was well furnished| clean| neat and modern. Staff were always friendly| helpful| respectful and did their jobs well. The beach had hardly any coral and the sand was soft and amazing. The pools were clean and warm. The view was amazing and the resort was always peaceful and calm. The pancakes served are definitely the best pancakes I have ever eaten in my life and the food is delicious. There were many different and fun things to do for everyone and we never ran out of things to do. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a holiday away with family or even friends. I hope to visit the Resort again soon!,Bristol| United Kingdom,09-04-17,Yes,5
Idyllic holiday,From the moment we arrived we knew we were in a special place | all of the staff were friendly and helpful & plenty of them | nothing was too much trouble . Our room was lovely | beautiful view of the garden from our balcony & the bathroom was amazing & spotlessly clean . We had full board | the breakfast was buffet style with everything you would want | there is a choice of restaurants | all of the food was absolutely delicious.,Bristol| United Kingdom,09-04-17,Yes,5
Superb,Stayed with my family in the tropical junior suite and absolutely loved our time here. The resort is huge and set in lush landscaped gardens| which make it very serene| even though it is located in the touristy and populated north of the island. The suite itself is very comfortable and large with an outdoor shower| separate water closet and a huge bathroom with a tub and indoor shower space. The flooring in the shower area is slatted wood which makes the water drain easily and is a welcome change from the usual tile. My kids loved the miniature bathrobes and slippers| such a personalized and thoughtful touch. Each annex of suites has their own pool| large enough to swim in| so that one doesn't really need to use the grand main pool| although that's great too. The kids were so busy with the beach and pool and the weather stayed so fine that we didn't use the kids club this time| although there is one at the resort. The food was plenty and the service| especially from Mr. Anwar| was outstanding. The chefs too went out of their way to prepare individual dishes for the children on demand. The buffet had different theme nights and our favorite was the Mauritian one. We also tried the Italian restaurant and really enjoyed the food there. Sundowners on the beach were also fabulous.Service in general was first class| with staff greeting guests by name| which takes some doing in a resort as large as this one| over 300 guests at a time. A special mention for Ms. Fatima| who is a mainstay here and without whom the resort wouldn't be the same.Loved it| and are going back relaxed and refreshed| exactly what we wanted from our beach holiday! We hope to return.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,04-04-17,Yes,5
Pure relax,Wonderful Hotel. We had room #300 with private pool and veranda on the geound floor with access to the garden and beach. Ocean view. Superbe deluxe furniture and great room division.Relaxed and charming staff. Very attentive to every detail. Extraordinary main pool. Wonderful curated garden area.Good choice of restaurants. Especially the indian one is worth to visit. Had a delicious dinner. And a very charismatic waiter.Would come back again. For sure.,Johannesburg,30-03-17,Yes,5
Beach dinner in paradise,"This was a holiday with 2 special frineds to celebrate their 60th birthday. A group of 10 staying in the resort and 3 staying just outside. The management (Linda) were very accommodating in allowing those staying outside to join us for meals and to spend time with us on the beach. The resort is set amidst well-kept tropical gardens and one feels as if you are living in a botanical garden. We stayed in the suites facing onto the lagoon with private balcony and slate ""splash"" pool which are laid out in spacious crescents offering absolute privacy. A Russian couple staying in one of the bungalows near us took the ""privacy"" a little too far and created quite a stir with their antics in the pool. The resort has a wide range of food experiences - 6 restaurants including Thai| Italian| Indian| Mediterranean (The Deck)| fish| buffet and ‘A la Carte’ dining at the Caravelle. Our favorites were the Italian and The Deck. The Indian offered mediocre fare with very small portions. We were on a dinner| bed and breakfast package. You can eat in any of the restaurants (booking essential especially on the weekend) - but beware - there are supplements to be paid on certain choices - the menus lay this out very clearly| so take note. Drinks are expensive and a lunch with drinks around the pool can cost a bomb. So - eat a hearty breakfast - the buffet is endless| fresh and interesting.The service is generally good| however| some of the staff were unhelpful and unfriendly.The gym layout is very good for a resort. There is a weights room| a cardio room and an aerobics room. These are set out next to the tennis courts. I enjoyed the Hamman steam room after my workout.I did not use the spa| but friends did. The experiences varied| most found the ""paper underwear"" you have to wear to be embarrassing. However| the actual massages and treatments were enjoyable. The setting is very tranquil and private.Beach activities are well managed. There are Hobie Cats| Stand Up paddling| Wind Surfing| Pedalloes| Canoes| water skiing| paragliding| snorkeling etc. Beware of the hawkers on the beach - they will harass you if you so much as look at them and they don't take ""no"" for an answer. The target the woman folk.I did some scuba diving. The dive shop is well equipped and the staff friendly and efficient. The die boat was well maintained and clean. There are dive sites right in front vof the resort and I had two very good dives - one on the reef (in good condition - unlike the lagoon that has been destroyed) and one on a wreck (only four years old| so not much sea life on it yet).Be careful when swimming outside of the buoyed off areas on the beach. There is constant boat traffic in front of the beach and my wife and I nearly had a Rapala fishing lure stuck in us by a passing fishing boat.All-in-all| this was a trip we will never forget. The highlight was the dinner for 13 the resort arranged for us on the beach - it was so special and looked so good that we had other guests taking photographs the whole evening. I long to return.",Johannesburg,30-03-17,Yes,5
Site inspection for future company conference,While on vacation from the US at the Four Seasons At Anahita we took a day trip to view this property on recommendation from friends who stayed and loved it. No one greeted us or informed us of the hotel policies for visiting guests on arrival . We took a walk to look at the restaurants| pools and beach. We were refused service in the Caravels restaurant because we were not a registered or paid guest informed we would have to pay approximately $100 resort fee each. We felt most unwelcome and disrespected. I did inform the front desk who barely responded. We left immediately a sure way not to promote business!IMG_4036.JPGguest,Johannesburg| South Africa,25-03-17,Yes,1
Most amazing holiday,My CEO and her family recently stayed in one of the private Villas and they absolutely LOVED it! The service was absolutely outstanding. They especially want to commend and thank Karen| Rajeev| Meenakshi & Prateemah for their level of excellence in taking care of them and making their holiday one for the books! Wonderful service - Beautiful property - Fantastic experience - Extraordinary holiday! Thank you - We'll be back!,Johannesburg| South Africa,23-03-17,Yes,5
Fantastic stay,Trou aux biches Golf Resort & Spa is a fantastic hotel in great surrounding. Water sport activities were excellent and included in the price. We had two nice beach houses for 4 people with 2 private pools. With 6 restaurants the food variety and quality was at a high level and especially La Caravelle stood out with high quality dinning. ,Triolet,21-03-17,Yes,5
Fantastic hotel with amazing suites,"My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights towards the end of our stay in Mauritius visiting family. We booked a junior suite on a half board package. As my wife and I were married a few months ago| we were able to use their discounted ""honeymooners"" rate when booking. We just needed to show our wedding certificate when checking in. Our room was perfect - very spacious| with a king sized bed that was so comfortable. The bathroom was equally impressive| with a walk in shower wet room. The hotel information system on the TV was very useful| giving updates of what activities are taking place around the easier each day. It also provided an up to date itemised bill of your stay. We dined at several of the restaurants at the resort. Most of them need reservations so book ahead. La Caravelle - really nice food with attentive service. Le Deck - was ok. For some unexplained reason| our reservation did not make it to the restaurant but they managed to squeeze us in. Set menu was nice but appears understaffed as service was slow. Blue Ginger - great tasting food. This was a taster menu| but the waiter confused us with his explanation and didn't seem to understand that we were on a half board package. However the manager soon clarified things and offered us a discount as an apology which was a nice gesture as we did not even complain. Overall my wife and I had a great time here. The suites are amazing and we did not want to leave at the end of our short stay. If I had negative| and it's a very small one| is that the resort is very big and it's quite easy to get lost as all the suites look the same. There could also be more outdoor lighting around the paths as it can be hard to make your way around during the night. ",Monte-Carlo| Monaco,20-03-17,Yes,5
Best if you are Honeymooners !,Lovely resort - but 95% of the couple's (in March anyway) are honeymooners. It is not the best time of the year to visit the resort (cold sea| not much sun and cool days). The site is fantastic and so are the accommodations. The food is quite good - with the exception of the Indian restaurant| where I fell ill twice on a meal. I would return| in a better season. Try the sister resort in the south of the island - Paradise. Simply wonderful - but a bit more remote...no charming towns nearby.,Monte-Carlo| Monaco,14-03-17,Yes,4
lovely luxury resort but not too pricey,if you have been to a few luxury resorts| this mostly lives up to the others. great beach| pools and restaurants| only thing is they have sand flies there so take cream against them and don't sleep with the door open !!,Swansea| United Kingdom,13-03-17,Yes,5
Great place ,The hotel is great| big structure plenty place at the beach. Many different restaurants| staff is really kind. Vegetarian food choice could be better| the fitness studio is really good for an hotel. And the spa is a place where you need to go. ,Luxembourg City| Luxembourg,13-03-17,Yes,5
Unique location,Excellent service| great dining| gorgeous location| beautiful rooms| great spa. Very nice people and located direct at the beach. Very romatntic for couples| relaxing and private. Fine dining| great pool.,Netherlands,11-03-17,Yes,5
The word excellent is not enough,"I am not one to write reviews but feel that I must as this hotel surpasses all expectations. There are many ""good"" hotels but in the case of Trou Aux Biches| I must say that the service| quality of food| rooms and facilities offered are excellent. If you are lucky enough to stay here| may I offer you three tips.1) Book the Escape plan which is like an all-inclusive.2) Introduce yourself to the Assistant Manager - Fatima who can always be found on the property. She is probably the kindest and most personable person I have ever met and is a true Ambassador of the Mauritian people. 3) Stand at the main pool around 18.00 hours and enjoy the most fantastic sunset you will ever see.",Saltsjobaden| Sweden,10-03-17,Yes,5
Perfect holiday experience,It is a wonderful place with great park like campus| it provides a wonderful beach with good swimming opportunity at any tide conditions| there is good selection of free of charge water sport activities| the diving is very bargain,Triolet,08-03-17,Yes,5
Pure Luxury - Best Holiday Ever,I took my wife to Mauritius to celebrate her 40th birthday this year. We booked a Sr. Suite Beachfront unit| and expected it to be nice| but our expectations were blown away. 1st the unit was massive| with a full living room| master suite with indoor and outdoor shower| and large deck that both the master and living room opened onto with a spectacular view of the beach and ocean. Let me just say the sunsets were 2nd to none. The unit was on the 2nd floor| so you had the view| and got the sounds of the water| and down the stairs from the deck was your very own Infiniti pool and sun deck. It was very private given the landscaping| and so luxurious that we did not want to leave.The resort itself was just beautiful. It's landscaping and gardens are amazing| and the beach front just spectacular. There are several restaurants so we made reservations and visited each one for dinner. The food was to die for. Again| I was not expecting this. Also I don't eat seafood| so each meal they substituted items for me and I did not have to settle. With the exception of 1 night| the wait staff were very good. What I was amazed by was how clean everything was. But it soon became clear| when we were in our unit one morning and they cleaned. It took an hour| every surface was wiped down| the floors mopped| windows done etc. This happened every day. When we did venture beyond our luxury domain| we were just steps away from a cornucopia of water sports and other activities. This was all free| from the sailing with real hobby cats (not the typical stripped down resort versions)| SUP| wind surfing| water skiing| wake boarding| snorkeling (they take you by boat out to the reef)| etc. We also did a morning scuba drive one day with the hotel scuba center. It was a great experience| with at least 10 giant turtle close encounters. We loved our trip| and hope to bring our kids back one day when they are older.,Chesterfield| Missouri,07-03-17,Yes,5
Fanstastic,WowWhat a great hotel and resortSomething for everyone Close to shops |restaurants and barsThe service is superbLocation is excellent Facilities for kids | families are brilliant 6 restaurants to suit your taste Stunning beaches and awesome poolsSome villas have their own splash pools on the beachThe management is extremely attentive | professional and efficientHighly recommended and well done to the manager forMaking this short stay really memorable ,Singapore,07-03-17,Yes,5
Great holiday ,My son and I recently stayed at Troy aux Biches after my husband had to suddenly cancel. I was a bit worried being just the two of us and my son being a 17 year old. But we had an amazing time| the staff where very friendly and helpful| the restaurants (all 7) couldn't be faulted| no wonder we came home some kilos heavier. Our room was very spacious. The beach was superb and you're spoilt for choices on water activities. You can be as busy or as lazy as you want. I'd go back in a heartbeat. ,Singapore,06-03-17,Yes,5
Unforgettable sunsets," Very nice hotel on the very east of the island where you can enjoy burning sunsets. Very good service| especially ""waiters in blue"" on the pool area - Rajesh| Vinay and Nitish! They can get any food or meal for you! Better place to settle - sea view suits| villas are too far away from the beach. But you need to book them very much in advance.Restaurants a la carte must be booked in advance and are always fully booked. We'd like to have bigger choice of restaurants| of course.Special thanks to Arthur from guest relation team - this guy is always ready to help! P.S. don't leave shoes on the beach - they can easily disappear. ",Pretoria| South Africa,06-03-17,Yes,5
A Euphoric Experience,We have just returned from a 7 day stay at Troux Aux Biches resort|during which we had a faultless superb holiday| during which we were spoilt rotten. Nothing was too much to ask for. The staff| food| weather and even the fishing ( a Blue Marlin) was perfect. Thank you all,Pretoria| South Africa,04-03-17,Yes,5
superb resort in a splendid surrounding,the trou aux biches is a superb resort with a very spacious| fantastic garden| a paradise like beach and all comfort to be expected form a five star resort. The staff is extremly helpful and friendly. the six restaurants provide a wide range of excellent food. the guest come from all over the world. the spa is beautiful and provides first class treatments. ,Triolet,03-03-17,Yes,5
Beautiful hotel but feels a bit wedged in between others,Lovely rooms| food good. Water sports on offer were great although the area for windsurfing was limited.Tennis courts and gym very well appointed. Enjoyed the smaller pools for each cluster of rooms - some shade and less noisy. ,Leicester| United Kingdom,02-03-17,Yes,4
A rare combination of physical and operational excellence,The fabulous location and the intelligent integration of buildings and nature makes the Trou aux Biches Beachcomber an exceptional resort. Moreover the staff displays a great combination of professional skills| perceptive empathy and genuine friendliness dominated by the pride in their Island.The estate is so large that the beach| the gardens| the (five or six) pools and all public areas give you a feeling of being in an almost semi-private environment.The excellent food is varied in the five different restaurants and prices are fair for food supplements and beverages.The only weakness is the service at the bar where for some mysterious reason| the staff appears to be less friendly and unmotivated.We definitely intend to be back!,Corseaux| Switzerland,01-03-17,Yes,5
Great spa| lovely beach front suite,This is our second time at this resort. It is big and occasionally it feels crowded. We absolutely love the beach front suites| spacious and elegant . The sea is clear and the sand is white and fine. Definitely the best beach at the northern part of the island. Good spot to watch a sunset although the beach is always busy and quit noisy. Breakfast is OK| big variety but not the quality you would expect for a five star hotel. Service at the restaurants especially at busy times is not so fine tuned. The boat house is very good. Variety of water sports Inc water ski are included. Special thanks to Ricardo for his patience during water ski. The clarins spa is a must. Make sure you spend some time at its beautiful relaxation area and its serenity pool. Another special thanks to Poonam for being so attentive and sorting out all my spa appointments last minute. Ali (Spa therapist) did miracles with all my aches and pains| he is a great professional and a healer| eternally grateful . we will visit again. ,London| United Kingdom,26-02-17,Yes,4
5 Start Hotel of the highest quality-service excellent| food amazing| hotel room spacious| infinity pool +great for kids,Hotel is massive| in addition to two separate buffet areas it has several restaurants with food along the lines of the top restaurants in the world. Rooms are massive as hotel has been built sideways rather than upwards. Has 5 pools (one main) and one of the largest kids pool I have ever seen! I did not go into the side pool but the main one was well heated. Hotel spans the equivalent of three hotels (therefore the name three beaches). Quality of sand is high - white soft sand. Limited seaweed and a bit of coral (not spotless but limited coral) but beach is very high quality - not like a typical beach in say Europe. Service of the staff was exceptional and every evening there was a show. One of the buffet stations have a live pianist or jazz player every night. Kid play arear is massive and hotel has several tennis courts| table tennis| gym| fantastic spa| etc... I have been to several top 5* hotels and this is clearly up there with the top few (not the top though!). Quality of beds was awesome and a good nights sleep every night - the size of the kids cot bed was also good and sturdy (wooden).,London| United Kingdom,19-02-17,Yes,5

Spectacular service and sunsets,We stayed in June 2015 and can testify it's a wonderful resort with everything in the one place.

Disgraceful Service By Non Other Than Management Itself,If you are thinking of staying at the Beachcomber Trou aux Bisches hotel| don't. Management| especially the food and beverage manager are arrogant and don't deserve to run a five star hotel. Certainly five star arrogance.It all started when we checked in. The person who checked us in told me that on the half board package| dinner and breakfast had everything included| including beverages. Well we were surprised to find out that these were not included and prices are astronomical. What's more is that half board guests are still charged a supplement for many meals. Again by no means a small amount.Anyhow| we put this all behind us and have 4 wonderful days. Then today we have lunch at the pool as we have done before and they tell us that the ala carte menu is not available but there is a buffet for 1000 rupees. When we come to pay| the bill is not for 1000 rupees but for 1400 rupees a person. When I query this with the manager| he says that it is 1000 rupees for full board guests| but 1400 rupees for others. When I booked at the hotel| they told me that there was no full board.Anyhow| as my son was a guest for the day| we asked him to stay for dinner. When he got dressed he wore a perfectly acceptable pair of short and closed shoes. So we go into the restaurant and a person| who we later find out is the food and beverage manager seats us. The waiter then takes our drinks order and we get our starters from the buffet.Another waiter walks up to our table when we are eating and he says my son cannot be in the restaurant with shorts. I explain to him that he's my guest and we were not aware.He leaves it at that. The first waiter then puts the drinks. Lo and behold another waiter comes up and repeats the same story. I ask him what he expects us to do. He merely says| it's hotel policy. So I ask for the manager. The same arrogant person| (I will not call him a manager as he could not organise a piss up in a brewery)| again tells me it's hotel policy. Just the a male of about 15 walks past in short and slip ons. So I say to this arrogant creature| then why are you not telling this to this person. He says because he's only a child. I then ask him why woman can wear shorts and skirts that barely cover their backsides and slip ons but nothing is said to them.All he could answer 'but this is hotel policy'. I said to him| 'well what would you like me to do' and again all he could mumble is that this is hotel policy and they'd already asked others to leave because the men were wearing shorts. Let's not forget that the economy in Mauritius survives on tourism and this is a holiday resort.So I ask him to call the general manager and his response is that 'he is a manager and he doesn't know if the general manager is available'. I say well then call the Assistant General Manager| as we'd met her. By this time my son was so embarrassed that he hands plate to the manager and says| I tell you what I just won't eat here if it's such a problem. Remember he was my special guest who we will not see for another 2 months. My wife proceeded to do the same and in fact told me to change our air tickets to tomorrow so we could go home.This is all because one idiot has no discretion and cannot handle a situation with a guest. On the way out of the restaurant we meet the Assistant General Manager| who listens to my ranting and raving telling her that our special holiday is now ruined due to one incompetent 'manager'. She apologises and says although it's policy it could have been handled in a much better manner. She offers us dinner in another restaurant. I said we'd rather pay the tray charge and order room service. Well in fact she actually took care of the whole meal. It's not her fault that the food was cold.So once we are finished| we take my son to reception to get a taxi and this arrogant person| (I refuse to call him a 'manager' because he isn't one)| again approaches us and says he apologises. For what I say? He should be pleased he has spoilt our holiday for us| paid with well earned money. He merely says| OK and storms off in a huff| (as if it's our fault).Now I'm left with the problem that my wife is so upset that she wants me to change our flights to go home tomorrow| even if it costs money.What a disgrace Beachcomber. We were thinking of bringing 6 people to the hotel for a holiday in December and spending over 900000 rupees. Well you won't see a cent of that money now. I'd rather stay at Club Med where we are platinum members and are treated as such. This manager's arrogance actually saved me a lot of money| so 'thank you'.I intend to tell as many people as I can if this bad experience and I will certainly encourage them not to stay at any Beachcomber resort| and more particularly not at Trou aux Bisches hotel. DISGUSTED,Pretoria| South Africa,12-02-17,Yes,1
Absolutey AMAZING!!!!,Stunning property| gorgeous rooms| excellent service! Fatima the GM was absolutely amazing| the staff are friendly and the beach is just so tranquil.

The outside showers were a hit!,London| United Kingdom,01-02-17,Yes,5
Fantastic getaway resort,I booked a week away here after a much needed relaxing getaway after finishing my MBA| and it did not disappoint. The beach was absolutely perfect: clean| warm enough| and that picture postcard aqua blue. The resort was designed beautifully to fit in its surroundings| and the architect did a stunning job. I liked having several restaurants to choose from| which meant that food never got boring. I enjoyed that activities like sailing (small boats) and diving were made available directly on the resort| and I immensely enjoyed them. The room itself was comfortable and spacious: the bathroom alone was bigger than some flats I used to live in during my younger days! Only point worth making is that this is very much a couples resort. That doesn't bother me; I've been single for quite a while that I don't even notice couples as couples anymore| but it certainly made my friend feel insecure and self-conscious. Surely it's her issue and not the hotel's| but worth mentioning. Especially because If you want any kind of nightlife (i.e. a bar or something) you'll find the hotel far too quiet and will need to book a taxi into town - about 20 minutes away. But as I was specifically looking for a proper escape| I was very happy with this.,London| United Kingdom,29-01-17,Yes,5
Sublime relaxation,We chose to stay at the Trou aux Biches as it was in the north of the Island and seemed to offer enough for both adults and adolescents. We weren't disappointed| the hotel and our room was fantastic| so spacious and clean| the variety of restaurants and the amount of food served even on a half board basis was unbelievable. The beach front and the beach where phenomenal plus the watersports that were included in the price really left us spoilt for choice. Our only dissappoinment was that we had to leave. We left there so relaxed and rejuvenated. ,Triolet,26-01-17,Yes,5
Fantastic resort and location,Travelled to Mauritius last week of Oct during the UK Half Term and had a fabulous time! It was absolutely stunning - picture postcard quality sea and location. The hotel was spot on - I took some persuading as high expectations but it was a really goodfit for our family. We loved the family suite. Largest family accommodation we've experienced. Resort was very clean| the pools dotted around the villas were an added bonus when the main pool was busy| or the winds the main pool were exposed to picked up. A speed boat took us to the reef up to 3 times a day and that was a particular highlight to every day! It's not the healthiest reef but there is plenty to see and our children got a real thrill out of the snorkelling.The water activities were a god send - fantastic to have that included in the resort fee. Kayaked| paddle boarded and had catamaran sailing lessons. A turtle swam underneath my daughter's SUPB meters from the shore! The beach vendors were low key and did not detract from the stunning location.Food wise| great choice of restaurants though service and wait times werevaried. I don't think they have enough staff. Was not a huge fan ofthe buffet style so I know I wouldn't want a buffet only option in thefuture but the quality was very good. The Thai and Indian restaurants offered lovely food and ambience. Slight negatives| one beach towel allocated to you per day was annoying but I thinkecologically sound - and tbh you could hunt a new one down but not the abundance available that perhaps you're used to! Trouble with finding sun beds occasionally around the main pool and limited food and drink service around the pool but these are all fyi and really should not put you off booking! The sea was busy with many of independent speedboat sports. We took a driver for half a day and drove around the North of the island| weavoided the tourist spots that were being sold in the lobby and instead saw lots of villages| sugar and pineapple plantations and got a feel for the north island - which was great and very important to help put perspective on our lovely bubble! We enjoyed the fact that there was life happening on the island - school kids| buses| work. All in all a great holiday and well worth the flight time! Fantastic location with little to no jet lag.,London| United Kingdom,24-01-17,Yes,5
Amazing Service and Beauty,From the first moment you walk into reception overlooking the pools towards the beach you feel like you're in paradise. The staff were incredibly attentive and helpful and felt like friends at the end of our stay. The food was amazing especially the 'Beach Party' lunch day and I highly recommend the crab and coconut salad served in a coconut. This is a resort made for relaxing and it was by far the best swimming beach we tried in Mauritius. Definitely looking forward to our next visit.,Johannesburg| South Africa,24-01-17,Yes,5
Wedding,I attended the hotel several times over the holiday due to a friend getting married. Fiona| the wedding coordinator met us at the entrance with a drink. We then made our way to the beach. The wedding was lovely but the high light was the gastro restaurant. The food was out of this world! ,Triolet,23-01-17,Yes,5
WELLCOME TO HEAVEN,it is an A MUST SEE PLACE| very relaxable and full of ambıance | the locatıon| the personell| the nature are all ın a good harmony and also the food go and enjoy it| ıf you know what you are lookıng for )))))))))))))),Triolet,19-01-17,Yes,5
Beautiful resort,We stayed at Trou aux Biches for 12 nights in December 2016 to January 2017. The resort itself is absolutely beautiful with beautiful gardens and it is right on the beach. Unfortunately the beach is a public beach and next to a camp sight for the locals so it was very busy with a lot of people walking up and down including a lot of hawkers who were very irritating.The beach itself and quite a few stones and coral so it was not easy to get in and out the water. We have previously stayed at Le Paradis which is also a Beachcomber hotel and the beach there was a lot cleaner with soft white sand and also more private as it is not easily accessed by the locals.The rooms are very spacious although not all sea facing| whereas at Le Paradis all the rooms are seafacing. We had a problem with the lighting in the room. The lights were extremely dim| but the issue got resolved after we complained. My advice is definitely to book a sea facing room. The rooms were serviced twice a day and the staff provided everything that was requested.There are 5 different restaurants at the resort as well as the buffet restaurant which you can eat at. There was Indian| Mediterranean| Italian| Seafood and Thai. The food at the Indian restaurant was amazing! It is also nice to have dinner at the Italian and Mediterranean restaurants as they are right on the beach and also have live music.The pool area is wonderful with service to order drinks and food which was very nice.The spa is also beautiful with the rooms being partial open. There was a magnificent pool and sauna and the treatments were very good. A real treat.The staff were extremely friendly and attentive and overall the service was very good. The GM Fatima was around at all meal times to check that everything was ok. Fatima was extremely friendly and organized and a special thanks to her for making our stay extra special.,Johannesburg,16-01-17,Yes,5
MASS TOURISM on a heavenly beach,This was not a place for us. TOO big| too impersonal| too noisy. The first night was very disturbing| as our room was next to the road and I barely slept. The room was also rather depressing| soulless I may call it. I inquired about the noise the next day and we realised that we also had been put in a lower category room than we had booked. There was not much of a sorry or anything else from the receptionist and later on we were moved into a much more charming bungalow. However| soullessness seems to be my word for the room design. It just lacks LOVE. LIGHTING was terrible| the white light over the balcony door reminded us of a garage and luckily my husband figured a way to disconnect it. The beach - however busy and with a way too high chair density - is stunning. There are a number of choices of restaurants at the resort and they are nicely decorated| food is pretty good - but just way too busy and too big for our taste. I recommend this hotel to group holidays and big families.,Monaco-Ville| Monaco,11-01-17,Yes,3
Value for Money?,We spend Christmas/New Year at TAB. The beach| garden| activities and some of the restaurants are excellent. We came with very high expectations since the price we paid calls for a top notch luxury resort in all aspects. We left generally disappointed. The rooms are large| comfortable and practical| however with the exception of the bathrooms they miss the charm and luxury one may expect. For a family of 3 you may also think that more than 1 bottle of complementary water per day should be provided without having to ask for it a number of times. A fresh fruit basket on a daily basis in all room categories should be standard. Part of the staff is very helpful and polite but unfortunately| this credit goes to a minority only. There are 6 Restaurants and we tried all of them except one. The food and services ranges from average to very good depending on the place you pick. The main restaurant offers a comprehensive breakfast selection but comes with a miserable and generally unfriendly service. The attendants discourage you from getting a table under the palm trees after a morning shower simply because they don’t like to place the table for you. La Caravelle can match expectations in terms of quality and service. If you are a half board guest| do not expect that all dishes come free. For quite many| such as choosing a tenderloin steak| you have to pay a supplement. The beach seafood BBQ is a highlight but then again it comes at a heavy extra charge. TAB’s location offers awesome sunset scenes and the hotel complements this with some nice early evening music entertainment. The more it is a pity that the service at the main bar is not only very poor it literally does not exist. If you are tired of waiting the best option is walking to the bar to order your favorite drink. Still it will take quite a while before your drinks are served – and do not expect nuts or crackers to come with it unless you insist getting some. We almost got the impression the management does not want their guests to take an aperitif before dinner. Well this was our first trip to Mauritius and at peak season| but what we take back from TAB is a mismatch in value-for-money.,Hong Kong| China,09-01-17,Yes,3
Heavenly!,We have just returned from a 2 week stay at the amazing Trou aux Biches Beachcomber resort. Our 3 bed room villa was beautiful and very spacious| the hotel and grounds were all stunning. Pool and beach were superb. Staff and service were all excellent| especially Rajesh at the pool. The only slight disappointment were the restaurants. The Indian| Thai and Italian restaurants were all just off the mark and we found the set menus a little restricting.Buffet at L'Oasis was good so we ate there most nights. Highly recommend the in villa Mauritian curry and BBQ.All in all a wonderful holiday and we would definitely return.,London| United Kingdom,09-01-17,Yes,5
Luxury resort with some random service experiences,The resort is superb for relaxing and enjoying good food + different sports. We have been around a lot and this resort really met our expectation from all aspects except service was sometimes good and sometimes not that good. Its really not just one of few occasions when the service was below expected - waiters forgot so often parts of our order (example straw for the kids drink was forgot maybe 30 times but also remembered the same amount of times). Also the rush hour at breakfast was result of strangely inefficient coordination of welcoming people| taking drink orders and cleaning tables for new guests.But other than that the place is really awesome. Food is superb - we didn't try buffet but all the other places| and it was extremely high quality. People were friendly and the rooms were abnormally good: spacious| clean| modern| and all worked in them.If we decide to come back to Mauritius some day| we would definitely book Trou aux Biches again.,Mauritius,08-01-17,Yes,5
Amazing Holidays,We had one of the most amazing holidays at the Trou aux Biches Resort. We have been to a number of 5 stars and we can say that our stay there has been the best till now. Food variety and quality is awesome. Staff responsiveness is great.Overall an amazing experience.Any flip side? The bed mattress quality could be improved and the staff at the beach house.,Mauritius,05-01-17,Yes,5
Perfect family get away,"Relaxed| elegant| easy ...great with kids..awesome even. The rooms are spacious| comfortable| on the expensive side ( we got a family suite ).""Yes"" is the prevailing answer from the staff. Always helpful and willing to help. The setting is superb. The beach is perfect though the constant 'beach camelots' selling their wares is a little tiring - they do remain very polite and friendly| always.The hotel offers as many activities as you'd like...but we went to do nothing except sunbathe| eat| sleep and spend time with our kids. For that it was 'right on'.The staff is very friendly. Fatima| the general manager is perfect. Says hi everyday| remembers your name and your children's and is always making sure your stay is a comfortable as you expected it.Service at the main bar is the only below grade element...slow and not really up to par with this type of establishment.The restaurants ( 6 of them) are all pretty good though my favorites were the Italian and the Deck on the beach.We were there for Christmas and it was very super for the kids. The hotel had presents for all of them and not just little trinkets..real presents. The kids ours and everyone else's were overjoyed.There are theme evenings almost every night at the Deck...I highly recommend it and hope to return soon...",Paris| France,04-01-17,Yes,5
New Years 2016,Very friendly and helpful staff and guest relations team especially Fiona| Celine and Fatima were amazing. DO NOT book any offsite activities with Solis and their representative Jennifer. Hotel activities are much better and value for money. Jennifer booked my family and I got two boating experiences all of which were eventually cancelled. Complete disaster and waste of time and terrible customer service! A bad experience in an otherwise fantastic vacation.,Johannesburg| South Africa,03-01-17,Yes,3
Best beach on Island ,Without a doubt Best beach in Mauritius . Food good although main bar food menu needs a shake up ! As does service in this area . Staff on beach are fantastic and nothing is too much trouble . Rooms are nice but could be more luxurious . ,Johannesburg| South Africa,31-12-16,Yes,4
Excellent!,Absolutely amazing hotel! This hotel has everything| what have to be! Really nice garden| big pool and long beach. Sunsets are so romantics!I had room with open tropical shower. It was something not usual. View from terrace to garden is relaxing.Buffee is plentiful| mostly in indian style.,Tallinn| Estonia,30-12-16,Yes,5
Exceeded expectations,Fantastic resort well equipped for families and good service for Mauritius. Was upgraded from Shandrani (at a cost) which had really disappointed us. No all inclusive in December which was disappointing but they cater for toddlers meals at no cost and short notice which was fantastic. ,Johannesburg| South Africa,28-12-16,Yes,5
An expansive beach hotel with a dose of artistic shadows,It is a rather outdated 5 star hotel but the premises are so nice to walk in. Immense gardens and one of the best beaches on the island. Rooms are discrete and set in villas| so prepare to have a walk. The family liked it. The thatch roofs are a rarity nowadays and look nice. Meals were really nice and inventive. The staff is helpful and rooms service is ok but with rather long waits. Entertainment is quite good and not to miss| Unfortunately we do not lay golf| so there are no comments on the superb greens.,Mauritius,22-12-16,Yes,4
Great hotel| but other beachcomber hotels may suit some better,This was our third beachcomber hotel in Mauritius (we've also visited the Shandrani - too close to the airport - noisy| and Paradis). Trou aux Biches was completly rebuilt 6 years ago and now includes a large number of 2 and 3 bed villas with private pools. (Beachcomber's Dinarobin also has a number of villas| but they offer less privacy). We had a 2 bed villa with butler and private pool which was spacious and private and yet near all amenities. Breakfast at the villa prepared by the butler was a real plus and also a BBQ evening prepared by a hotel chef. The gym at the hotel is amazing - incredible quantity and range of equipment - we also appreciated the large number of tennis courts (free raquet hire). A golf course will open next year| but will be a short distance away. Good choice of water sports. The beach is nice enough but I think the setting and spaciousness of the dinarobin/paradis complex is nicer and given that overall the beach area is much larger| covering the whole of the Morne Peninsula| the beach at Paradis/Dinarobin is more private and doesn't get locals wandering through - although you will get hawkers on both beaches. The noise from the locals just down from the Trou aux Biches hotel beach was sometimes off putting. Other than that I concur with other posters on restaurant quality - 6 restaurants so plenty of choice. Service generally good although sometimes a bit slow and confused - one lunchtime we had a total of 5 separate hostesses come by and ask if everything was OK! All in a great experience.,Paris| France,21-12-16,Yes,4
Poor Check-out,We had a very negative check-out experience with the front person named Nikhesha. Essentially| we ordered a pick-up for our luggage to leave early for a flight the day after. The pick-up arrived 10min late which is why we chose to walk to the reception. At the reception| Nikhesha was very rude and instead of apologizing for the inconvenience| made a defensive comment about high traffic that morning. It is not my fault that the hotel is overburdened with servicing clients| but for a 5-star hotel| the least I can expect is an apology. Nikhesha then went on with her rude behavior| making a patronizing comment when I asked to remove a mistake from the bill which was - admittedly - very small ($1 equivalent) but in principle still a mistake and hence I wanted it corrected. Very sad our holidays at this great resort had to end on such a sad note. Hope the manager gets to have a word with Nikhesha to sort out her behavior.,Triolet,21-12-16,Yes,1
Thanks,Welcoming was excellent.Restaurant reservation was accessible which was really fantastic.Service and Food at the Italian Restaurant was just excellent.L'Oasis Restaurant has a very good varieties of food for breakfast and Dinner.Welcoming wasgreat.Thanks the staffs and the Manager.,Triolet,21-12-16,Yes,4
A special place in our hearts,My husband and I| 10 years ago| got married here and to celebrate our anniversary we went back to celebrate this milestone. Trou aux Biches has a special place in our hearts and they certainly make you feel special and at the heart of their beautiful resort. For the evening of our anniversary| they knew which of their 5 amazing restaurants we had booked| as booking for any evening meal is required. When we arrived| at Le Caravelle| they provided us with a 5 course menu. The table had rose petals sprinkled across their crisp white table linen| candle light and the grand finale| dessert| was spectacular. Upon settling the bill| the meal was complimentary and we did not have to pay anything other than the Rose sparkling wine that we ordered and the espresso martini's which were outstanding. When booking your evening meals for your stay| Linda was delightful and has the patience of a saint| as she is responsible for all meal reservations and has to deal with lots of people changing their minds| us included. Upon arriving| Fernando greeted us and made us feel welcome Mauritian style. The 7 days that we spent there was filled with spending time in the sea (which was about 28 degrees)| drying out on the sun loungers on the beach| sipping cocktails and beers| delivered to our beach lounger by Satish every day with a smile and a understanding of the regulars and what they liked. In the morning taking the Pedalows out to sea for a relaxing time drifting on the waves| enjoying the aqua blue| still as glass water.I would recommend anyone who wants some R and R time| this is the place to go| to reconnect| enjoy beach life and realise that the simple life is the best life.,London| United Kingdom,20-12-16,Yes,5
Great resort for families,We visited Mauritius in December 2016 with our 2 children (nearly 3 year old and 5 month old). We were a little apprehensive about visiting the resort with 2 young children but needn't have been. The resort is luxurious and works well for couples and young families. The staff were faultless and couldn't have done more to make our stay comfortable. In particular Veenaye at the pool and Rajiv at Le Deck.We stayed in a family suite which was very large and comfortable. The novelty of the outdoor shower doesn't wear off and is a great way to start the day. Our toddler loved the kids club where the staff were very good and there was always lots to do. The pools and beach are beautiful and very well maintained. The pool in particular is ideal for young children with plenty of shallow areas and ledges for them to rest and jump off. It looks out over a beautiful beach. We took a trip on a boat to see the dolphins which was also great.The food is of a very high standard but extremely expensive. This isn't unexpected at a 5* resort and fortunately is all good quality. The staff also go out of their way to accommodate dietary needs and requirements for kids.Overall I can't fault the resort and would have no hesitation recommending it for families of all ages. Fatima works tirelessly to ensure guests feel welcomed and her staff are highly attentive. Thanks for a wonderful stay.,London| United Kingdom,19-12-16,Yes,5
Top class,We stayed for 10 days with a 15 month old. The staff were welcoming from the start. We had a beachside room and it was incredible. The restaurants are excellent quality with a choice of six. The beach is stunning and whilst it is public there is a hotel area patrolled by staff. The main hotel pool is excellent and perfect for all ages. The tennis set up is at a high level| the gym does the job. Thoroughly recommended. ,Reading| United Kingdom,19-12-16,Yes,5
Relaxing on the beach ,I stayed one week at Beachcomber Hotel and fulfilled my expectations.The junior suite was nice| spacious and comfortable. The beach has hot and calm water| white sand but a lot of vendors which could be unpleasant. The thematic Restaurante's are top with an excellent quality| recommend for foodies!,Milan| Italy,18-12-16,Yes,4
Close to perfect,This was my 1st time to Mauritius. I visited nov 2015. The resort has great rooms| super restaurants| fine service| good atmosphere| nice beaches. I have noting negative to report. Still it was not the same as a Amanreport| Oriental or a One&Only...but very close and at much better price/quality rate.,Milan| Italy,17-12-16,Yes,5
Amazing stay...,I have enjoyed my stay at Trou aux Biches for a short honeymoon and it has been really great. The entire holiday has gone smoothly and the overall package has been of the highest quality.The room we were given| a Tropical Junior Suite on the ground floor| was spacious| with enough closet space| a comfortable bed and an enormous bathroom| with both an internal and an external shower. The room was pretty clean| even though I would recommend to try to remove as many little animals as possible| especially ants| which sometimes came in from outside.The quality of the numerous restaurants was high and we were always served tasty food. Every restaurant had its own cuisine and my personal ranking of dinners in terms of quality was:1. La Caravelle - French cuisine2. Le Deck - creative cuisine3. Blue Ginger - Thai cuisine4. Il Corallo - Italian cuisineOn top of these there was the lunch buffet at L'Oasis| always good| and the Indian restaurant which we did not try out.The level of service was really high. The way our 10-month old child was treated was remarkable: he always had a cooked meal available and when we needed some assistance we were always helped. The SPA was very nice and I enjoyed a good shiatsu massage. Wifi was available in all places| including the stunning beach where we enjoyed some rest.What I honestly did not like is the fact that each and every drink| including still water| cost at least 100 MUR a bottle. In such a resort it should be included in the package.Still| I can recommend Trou aux Biches to anyone looking for a comfortable holiday in a dream location.,Milan| Italy,17-12-16,Yes,5
Very lively resort. Nice rooms with large bathrooms. Nice sand beach and pools.,This was one of 3 resorts we stayed at in Mauritius. It is very lively and active. Not desolate as other resorts we stayed at. One has to be prepared for large crowds. It's not a quiet resort and seems to be large.The room was very nice and the bathroom was large. However the only gripe is that it was a bit dark as we were on the ground level. One should try and get a room on the highest floor possible.We had access to a small pool and the large pool. The large pool was gorgeous and though we were told it was not heated| we were able to swim with no problems| though the weather in October was cool at times.The beach is lovely. It is a sand beach and we did not need water shoes like on some other beaches. They do sell plastic one's at the hotel shop.However because October weather is so variable| we only swam in the ocean 1 day of the 2 we were there. I regretted not going in November when it get's warmer.One should book dinner reservations the moment one arrives. We had a problem one evening and were obliged to eat at the buffet at the main restaurant.The food was mediocre at the buffet.Overall we enjoyed the hotel. But one must be prepared that it is a busy resort with lot's of people.,New York| USA,03-12-16,Yes,5
Perfect honeymoon !,It was our pleasure to spend 10 nights at this amazing resort. For us everything was perfect| starting with the room which was spacious and with a nice view ( tropical suite)| the great restaurants with friendly staff and finishing with the awesome beach. The beach was the thing that we loved the most due to the fine sand and great free nautical activities.Also| the have a luxury spa where we had a lovely day. My wife and I highly recommend it.,Cluj-Napoca| Romania,02-12-16,Yes,5
"a new hotel with ""old"" staff....",beautiful setting| beautiful beach! it's a brand-new resort| rather big! so don't expect much privacy! the restaurants are crowded and without reservations you end up at the cats table! that happens even when you book but for a late dinner time...most annoying is the discrepancy between the new| young staff and the old-timers! where the younger crew tribes hard to please whereas the unionized older staff could not care less to provide even basic services or information!what a pity...,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,30-11-16,Yes,4
Beautiful Place,Our family stayed here for 10 days in the end of November 2016. Great climate| not too or as hot as in Arabia| but you never have to wear a jacket or a sweater. Perfect for our kids age 3 and 5. The hotel is very well prepared| the vegetation is wonderful| dolphins are just around the corner| a turtle passed by on the ground while we were going water skiing in the laguna. The Boat House with Nicolas the boss| is perfectly prepared and very friendly and quite flexible to your needs| allowing us to monoski 2 hours before they officially open| right before breakfast. The guest rooms are close to the sea| spacious| always well prepared and very clean.The different restaurants provide good to very good food| the best is the saturday ev. Dinner on the beach. Make reservations early! Disadvantages: 1. lots of people are trying to sell you something on the public beach of the hotel. No worries| you get used to it after two days. 2. The service in the hotel is partially very poor| especially in the buffet restaurant and in the breakfast restaurant. Certainly| there is enough staff everywhere in the hotel| but it appears as if from the very top to the bottom there is the mentality that every person only does his specific job| and nothing else. If your glass or coffee cup is empty| and the restaurant or hotel manager passes| and after a polite small talk you kindly ask for a refill| your wish may get downtransferred twice and you may wait another 10-20 minutes because not you as a person or the service to be provided seems to be the priority of all the personal| but the individual duty the service provider is told to do. This top to bottom management problem appears everywhere in the hotel.Summary: yes| we loved out stay| yes we do want to come back and we do recommend the hotel| but don't expect a ritz carlton service. ,Munich| Germany,26-11-16,Yes,5
Wonderful Stay ,We went to get a little R&R and it ticked all the boxes. Even though the resort is large and busy it never felt like that and the gardens and palms are beautiful and well kept. The food was great but we got tired of the buffet as we were booked for 10 days and we really enjoyed there restaurants on site| especially the one overlooking the ocean. We had a great time and will be back ,Camberley| United Kingdom,23-11-16,Yes,5
Wow!,Beach fronted duplex with its own pool - just amazing| the only place to eat is le deck. Other restaurants are okay but must have separate management as quality and service is below par. An excellent resort and very friendly. ,Camberley| United Kingdom,16-11-16,Yes,5
A very nice hotel with superficial staff,The hotel is nice overall| but the staff from here is really superficial. You will encounter problems from the moment you arrive. Besides the staff| the hotel is really nice| has plenty of facilities (tennis court| spa| gym| ...) and plenty of good a la carte (the best in my opinion is the Thai one).Also| the beach is extremely nice and you will enjoy the time there. Also| the resorts has a nice pool with plenty of space and sun beds. The sunset seen from the pool is simply breath taking.If you want to go to the a la carte restaurant please make sure you book one day upfront and through the restaurants reservation service rather than the concierge.For relaxation| it is a must to try their Spa. They have a variety of massages from where you can choose and the personnel is really nice and welcoming.Overall| I think this hotel is one of the best from the North of the island and it definitely has the best beach. If you can ignore the superficial staff you will have a very pleasant time here.,Bucharest| Romania,15-11-16,Yes,3
Luxurious Resort with Exceptional Management and Service,To say the management and staff will do anything to make your stay exceptional is an under statement ... General Manager Fatima and her Guest Relations team appear to be aware of everything that's happening within this large resorts and seem to know all the guests by name| with any incident resolved without becoming an issue.The resort is stunning| set in a beautiful beach location with luxury accommodation. Rooms are exceptionally well appointed| clean and serviced twice a day by default ... room service is just a call away. The six restaurants provide an excellent choice and variety of food| with the main restaurant providing buffet-style food ... we particularly liked the Thai (Blue Ginger) Restaurant who spiced up our food.Water sports equipment is in good order and the Beach Team are there to get you on and off the water ... safety is also very good.The gym is well managed and the Life Fitness equipment is in excellent order ... tennis courts are also available and bikes to ride on site.Unfortunately we didn't try the Clarins Spa although we had a complimentary treatment in our package.Although this is a large resort| at no time did it appear crowded| noisy or having to wait for service| creating a relaxed and luxurious atmosphere ... thanks to all the friendly smiling staff and their attention to service and detail.,Weybridge| United Kingdom,15-11-16,Yes,5
Wonderful!,It's a long way to go with the family but so worth it.This is a fantastic family resort| great service| food and scenery with free water sports| tennis and gym.I really can't fault this and more importantly| neither can any of us| which includes children (boys and girls) Ranging from 7 to 17| two couples 45 to 50 and a Grandma in her 70's| we all had a wonderful| enjoyable and relaxing time.,Weybridge| United Kingdom,15-11-16,Yes,5
Incredible and Amazing Experience,Outstanding is the word. Must say it is one of the best property i have ever stayed. Everything was top class. Front Desk| Reception| Pool side| Private beach| Water sports| In Room dining. Chef Satish Rathod was awesome. He cooked some amazing Indian delicacies and great service. Will recommend one and all when in mauritius just head to Trou Aux Biches. Best Place.,Mumbai| India,14-11-16,Yes,5
Perfect relax.,Very friendly and elegant atmosphere| nice staff. Spacious and comfortable rooms. Excellent food. Tidy beach with a sufficient number of the sun beds. The only minus are too expensive beverages in the restaurants.,Triolet,13-11-16,Yes,4

Restaurants were great with choice of international| Italian| Indian and Thai. Also great water sports. Thoroughly recommend,London| United Kingdom,08-11-16,Yes,4
Very large and well run hotel,The accommodation is excellent and the gardens and pools very nice| but the water sports are very cramped for space. The food was hard to fault. The staff in the diving centre and the tennis coach were friendly and helpful.,North Pole| Alaska,02-11-16,Yes,4
Relax,Perfect location on the white sand beach| possible to have long walks on the beach up to 4 km long ( including Mont Choisy Plage up to Pointe aux Canonniers).Cosy rooms with a very good service| several small ' private' pools located just outside.5 restaurants (with prenotation required)| and one buffet restaurant with a very large choice of starters| hot meals| fresh fruit and... excellent patisserie française.Once for breakfast it took very long to get some coffee and tea; they apologised and offered a free lunch !Et war eng super Vakanz,Hesperange| Luxembourg,01-11-16,Yes,5
Superb Family Holiday,This is the most wonderful family stay. We have visited this resort over many years and we leave refreshed rested and with a yearning for our next visit. The beach is incredible. There are 6 restaurants to choose from but booking early is essential especially at peak times. The spa is heavenly and the therapists are world class. It is a large hotel but has been designed so well that you are not always aware of how full it is. Fatima is Trou aux Biche's Fairy Godmother| who makes magic happen and is always there to assist wherever she can. Chef Shazaad and Chef Julio are wonderful and always ready to please. Huge thanks to Menon who ensures excellent service at all times. To Lekraj and team at the Indian restaurant thank you - the chef at the Indian Restaurant is exceptional and has provided a variety of superb dishes here. Restaurant staff| Ouma| Satish| Jay| Tulsi| you are fantastic thank you.Beach staff - Ahad - Rishi and Dasmuth| - thank you for always making us feel so welcome. Best wishes to you all and Happy Diwali to all who celebrate.Thank you to Michel for always welcoming us to Trou aux Biche and for making our stay so comfortable always. Thanks agan Fati ( fairy godmother) see you next year.,Sandton| South Africa,31-10-16,Yes,5
Great hotel but poor service,This hotel is great| modern| and perfectly located. Problem is that the service quality is quite disappointed| not because the staff is not good| but because the staff is too much under demand. They should hire more staff.,Sandton| South Africa,30-10-16,Yes,3
Fantastic but possibly not for everyone,We are a couple in mid 50's | well travelled and used to 4 and 5 star hotels. There is little to find fault with at this hotel- but there are things to be aware of which might mean it is not for you:ProsAccommodation is outstanding whatever room I think you book- unless you are close to the Oasis restaurant in which case the music in the evenings from around 7 til 10 and during aqua gym- an hour in the morning might be mildly annoying.The hotel is large and extremely private with villas well separated from each other | with walled partitions. There are lots of beautiful trees and plants-you could almost be in a botanical garden / aviary such is the variety. Bed HUGE -1.80 wide. We experienced no insects in the room or around the resort. The conditioner they give is rubbish so bring your own and there is no body lotion offered which is poor for 5 star. If you don't like a long walk ask to be nearer the reception. All the accommodation is organised into 6 zones with villas arranged around its own pool. In addition there is the main pool near reception which is huge. All were v clean and warm.Food: extremely good- we ate at the Indian| Thai and International restaurants which are waiter service restaurants with choices from a menu as opposed to the main Oasis restaurant which is self service from an enormous buffet. All are beautifully furnished and the choice of food is large. The half board arrangement means you can choose from a more limited menu than the full board folk but the choice is plenty big enough. If you are paying for lunch- it is around 1100 for anything and as much as you want from a buffet- since we can't eat like this anymore we chose to walk south to the end of the beach and onto the main road where you can have a simple grilled fish and salad for 750 rupees for 2 - at the souvenir resto.You can choose to eat breakfast at either Oasis - where the choice is ridiculous- anything you would want -or at the International resto at the edge of the resort which is much smaller and quieter ( seems like the families with children don't come down this far)- and has about 75 % of the choice that Oasis offers. Make sure you go here at least once to eat in the morning and for supper where there is a really good piano player- sometimes accompanied by a singer or sax- but not loudly!Water sports: the snorkelling from the hotel is very good we saw parrot fish| angel fish| flute and trumpet fish| sea snakes| and about 30 diff varieties... make sure you get to go on the boat when it goes outside the reef- you see a lot more there- although inside is pretty good too. We did a dive but unless you can prove you have dived in last 6 maths they only take you on a shallow dive / refresher course- and we saw less than we did snorkelling ! This was with the dive school associated with the hotel- there are others nearby as an alternative - it cost us 2200 per person for 40 min dive only about 10 mins from the beach :(Water skiing is offered all day long and was easy to book- as were all water sports- but be sure to book snorkelling asap as it is v popularWi fi excellent everywhereThe gym was outstandingly good and wouldn't shame a small private gymCons- all minorBed was hard so we asked for an extra thin top mattress- which they did immediately- but we needed 2 of these because they were intact just duvets!Conditioner useless as mentioned and no body lotionPrice of wine ridiculous Price of massages the same as what we pay in Zermatt| Switzerland- which seems madThere is a lot of boat activity from the hotel and neighboring hotels and quite a few hawkers( all quite polite) - which we didn't mind as we were responsible for taking advantage of what was on offer-water skiing and snorkeling and sailing...The swimming lane is v limited so for those who want to swim in the sea,Divonne-les-Bains| France,28-10-16,Yes,5
A honeymoon to remember!,My husband and I stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon in October 2016.It is a spectacular place in the northwestern part of the island. A massive resort| with lovely beach| multiple restaurants and exotic looking pools| tucked away between the villas. No matter what| it is almost impossible to not like this place| despite some negative points listed below. We would definitely recommend this hotel to everybody.Positive points:- As we were on honeymoon| we were upgraded from half board to full board.- The breakfast buffet is excellent.Probably one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever experienced during travels. - We loved our outdoor shower (Tropical Junior suite)- The hotel has a high quality beach- The sunsets are amazing. One of the reasons we stayed on the west side of the island was to have the best sunset views and we were not disappointed.- Staff is very friendly| both at reception as in all restaurants| as the cleaning personnel.- The hotel offers a nice range of restaurants with good quality food. It was hard to pick a favorite| they are all very nice.- There are free water sports: pedalos| kayaks| snorkeling| paddle board and water ski- We loved the pool close to our villa| it was an oasis of peace. - On the last day| we were given the room for the entire day as our flight was only scheduled at 23:30 and taxi pick up at 19:30| something we really appreciated- We hardly left the resort but never got bored as it's so impressive.Negative points:- All week we had seen the tables at dinner time| full with rose petals for honeymoon couples| so we were quite enthusiastic about having our own one on the last night in the resort. We had chosen the Thai restaurant to have our honeymoon dinner. When we got there| the Thai restaurant was exceptionally closed for dinner (no real reason given) and staff had ensured we had a table in next door's Indian restaurant... But not a honeymoon table. So that was quite disappointing as we had been looking forward to it| and obviously had no chance to re-book. Maybe something to keep in mind when you book your own.- Staff were very friendly throughout our stay| but the service very inconsistent. During our first week we were served without any delays| the second week we had to wait up to 25 min to get our food / drinks / bill. Oh and| for some reason it takes 20 mins to make a latte| so if you are in a hurry| don't order lattes :)- The lunch menu is rather limited| it didn't change and if you stay in the hotel for longer than 1 week it becomes rather dull. - The tour we booked was sold as a snorkeling excursion. We were rather limited in our options as I am pregnant. In reality| this was a booze cruise| with hardly any snorkeling at all. By all means| we had a great day and loads of fun (even without drinks)| but it shouldn't be sold as a snorkeling day out.- The accommodation was lovely| but the only negative comment I would make is the hard mattress. I haven't slept well during our stay| I could not get comfortable and woke up every night with back pain. If you like hard mattresses| then you'll have no complaints. - The beach and main pool are fantastic| however| there are too many men trying to sell stuff on the beach which becomes annoying after a while and if you want a prime location at the pool| you better make sure you're there at 7am with your towel!,London,28-10-16,Yes,4
Simply the best hotel I have stayed in!,We stopped here for four nights on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a Seaview with a private pool. Simply spectacular. Breakfast was varied and delicious. The views are lovely| staff delightful. The two snorkelling trips we did were excellent and we saw loads of critters. We didn't do the all inclusive thing and found a variety of restaurants in walking distance for lunch and dinner. ,Chicago| IL,21-10-16,Yes,5
Little piece of paradise| honeymooners place,"I really enjoyed my staying at the Beachcomber. It's a 5 star complex that provides you the calm and perfect staying. In my case I don't rate with 5 bubbles because of a personal reason... I personally like the contact with other people| and this hotel doesn't help it. Of course if you look for a perfect honeymooner stay| like ""i just need being with my couple""| it's perfect for you. If you want to be a bit more social| is kind of complicated. But I repeat... Is really beautiful. ",Barcelona| Spain,21-10-16,Yes,4
3 bedroomed Villa ,Our stay has been wonderful. We were upgraded from a 2 bedroom Villa to a 3 bedroom. Our Villa and the Villa staff made our stay so pleasant. Our Butler Christina was so efficient| professional and pleasant| thank you for looking after us so well.Thank you also to Dinally our Villa manager who very professionally arranged everything during our stay. We did not need to leave our little oasis here at the hotel. The main pool and beach are very big so it was nice to have a place of our own. Restaurants and the food is very good. ,Zurich| Switzerland,20-10-16,Yes,4
Fantastic hotel | beautiful paradise,Very nice hotel | fantastic garden tons of very special trees and flowers. The room has an outside shower | the staff is very friendly | the hotel really all super nice. The beach is one of the best on the island|,zürich,17-10-16,Yes,5
Island style luxury,I stayed at the hotel for one night while I was on a charity cycle tour in Mauritius. The hotel is located near Mont Choisy in the north and within walking distance from local shops. I stayed in a luxury room (#132) overlooking the pool area close to the gigantic banyan tree. Spacious room and bathroom. Fantastic room but rather noisy with guests in the pool. I tried stand up paddling in the ocean for the first time. It is offered free of charge. Great overall experience.,Pretoria| South Africa,15-10-16,Yes,4
Excellent Resort| Great Facilites and Attentive Staff,We stayed for 14 nights in a beach front room with plunge pool. The room was a one walk to the beach and two of the restaurants.Resort facilities are excellent| with a large sandy beach front. There are several pools including several privately situated ones between the villas. No shortage of sun beds at the pools or on the beach.There are several restaurants and it's advisable to book in advance with Linda who is in the reception area.Our favourite was the Thai Blue Ginger.All staff are very friendly and attentive. We would thank Menon for looking after us at breakfast and dinner.If we come back to Mauritius then we will defiantly book here again.,Leeds| United Kingdom,14-10-16,Yes,5
Holidays at Trou Aux Biches / MRU,Very nice Hotel to spend a few exciting beach days with an amazing beach.The staff is very friendly as it can be expected for this class of a hotel.The amount of restaurants and bars is satisactory| the overall quality and variety of the different menues is excellent.The rooms are spacious with an appealing design.,Triolet,10-10-16,Yes,4
Beautiful reaort,We stayed here for 9 nights. We really wanted to extend our stay because the place was just amazing. We had the suite overlooking the beach and we couldn't get enough of such a pristine beach. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. It's always hard to travel with a toddler but this resort made me feel right at home!,London| United Kingdom,10-10-16,Yes,5
A dream wedding anniversary!,Just came back after spending a week in Paradise at the Beachcomber Trou aux biches resort! Evrything was perfect : from the spacious and very comfortable suite to the Beautiful beach. What made the stay even more special was the friendly and warm welcome of all the hotel staff! A special mention about the food as my wife and myself being food lovers we particularly enjoyed the very high quality and diversity of th restaurants: From the amazing Italian passing by the excellent Thai and Indian and perfect La Caravelle every meal was a pleasure here again with quality and diversity. One regret only we only discovered during our last evening the Deck restaurant ( but came back the next day for our last meal) . The food and welcome was even better than the other restaurants ! We can only recommend this resort with full board plus if you are like us food lovers ! We ll be back !!!,London| United Kingdom,08-10-16,Yes,5
Paradise revisited,This hotel is an amazing place| the staff were excellent in all areas| house keeping| front of house| restaurants and the pool/beach areas. Our pakage was half board so we decided to go to Port Louis and garnd bay for lunch both of which can be accessed by bus(very cheap) and taxi about £10 to £20 pounds return. Buses are efficient and run every 10/15 minutes.to both those areas. Overall an Excellent experience.,London| United Kingdom,07-10-16,Yes,5
A little corner of paradise!,We spent the most incredibly relaxing 4 days at Trou aux Biches. The calming beauty of the resort is just breathtaking. We had a stunning suite that faced the ocean with a private pool outside and it felt great waking up with the view and going for a walk on the beach. The staff are very attentive and made us feel so welcome. The Clarins spa is an oasis where you disappear for a few hours| get doted on and come out revitalized. All in all| an superb resort!,Accra| Ghana,03-10-16,Yes,5
Perfection,If you fancy a trip to Mauritius in September make sure it's nudging October| as although the weather is a perfect temperature to lie prostrate in without frying| the sea is still a little chilly and the rainstorms a little more inconvenient for the open air dining that the hotel specialises in. But never fear| Trou au biches is more like a village than a hotel| and it more than makes up for any early season mildness with the staff and quality of rooms and dining options. We stayed in a garden room| beach facing| with a plunge pool- right on the last block before the property finishes and runs in to a public beach area. This suited us well as it placed us within strolling distance of Le Caravel restaurant where we had breakfast every day and the Italian restaurant situated right next to it.This end of the hotel felt more select and are tucked away from the main Oasis self service and everything is a little more hushed.The room was just lovely with a view of palm trees and the setting sun| it's hard to imagine a more romantic setting. But the real wow moment is the bathroom| with indoor and outdoor options so you can shower without steaming up the room.Fresh beach towels are delivered every day and despite some comments on here we found the room's wi-fi to be pretty good. the TV channels are a little limited for English speaking but frankly we didn't really come to Mauritius for the TV entertainment.When you first arrive| bedraggled and exhausted from the 11hr flight (from London) it is tempting to curse the immediate approach of the beach hawkers as you arrange the towels on the heaviest wood sunbeds in the southern hemisphere.If you've ever travelled to Africa before| they come with the territory but here they are friendly and won't bother you if you just say no. Nevertheless as the days wore on we became more familiar with them and curious about their trinkets.I would recommend the cashmere seller as the scarves are made on the island along with many other brands but some of the pearl necklace guys are selling real pearls but jewellery more suited to 'Claire's Accessories'. Still| they look nice on a golden beach.We took a catamaran trip up to the north islands| which was spectacular but we instinctively avoided the trip sellers on the beach and found a small office near the post office on the cross-roads near the hotel. she was much cheaper and her company was fully licensed- unlike| according to her| the guys on the beach.But the hotel itself was immaculate| the staff friendly and simply couldn't do enough for you.I'm glad we went full board in the end as dining outside the hotel grounds didn't seem hugely appealing as the best restauarants were almost certainly within the grounds.There is a waiter service for drinks on the beach| but it's not too intrusive...so look out for the hotel guys and they can produce anything you need - they just don't pester you for the work!Regarding booking the restaurants| do it as soon as you get settled in| they do get booked up and there is always a line of people at the booking lady's desk which means she never answers the phone extension if you try calling from your room. We loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a romantic and restful break. One request though| if you are a couple| when you are sitting in one of the most romantic| exotic| perfect places in the world| having one of the finest dinners you will ever eat| try not looking at your sodding phones throughout the entire meal and try talking to each other!Maybe I am old fashioned| but it was just so sad to see at every table.Enjoy!,London| United Kingdom,03-10-16,Yes,5
Great hotel| great holiday,We spent 8 days at Beachcomber Trou aux Biches Resort and Spa| at the end of August. The experience was awesome. Beautiful rooms| good food (obviously cannot be compared to South African food)| friendly staff and beautiful beaches. Arriving we had been allocated rooms along the boundary wall| which was not great because of the traffic noise. On request we were moved to rooms on the other end of the hotel. Away from the traffic noise but also far from the reception and restaurants. I did not mind the walking given that I was going to miss my daily runs during this holiday. The outdoor shower was a hit| but the rooms were generally dark. There was a choice of six restaurants| but this was just theoretically as the restaurants were on a rotational basis. We found the main buffet restaurant to be better as it had enough variety to cater for the family.,Sandton| South Africa,02-10-16,Yes,4
Checked in 29 Sep 2016 - currently staying,We are currently staying at a two bedroom villa. I have stayed in several prestigious hotels but this is by far the most superb hotel I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. The accommodation is excellent - contemporary | spacious and state the art| The staff have ben out friendly and tentative to our every need. The villa is private and secluded with our own butler. A private pool adds a beautiful touch. Well equipped gym and easy access to an immaculate beach. .,Cape Town Central| South Africa,01-10-16,Yes,5
Wedding venue in Mauritius,Fiona our wedding planner was lovely| she had everything organised and was happy to accommodate any of our wishes. We could not fault hotel or its staff and many of them congratulated us on our wedding. They were all so helpful and made our stay special. Flying BA from England meant we were to check out well before departure and Celine the assistant manager arranged a late check out for us although we had to change rooms for two nights with a free seafront suite upgrade. Five restaurants cater for all tastes with delicious deserts. The reef is accessible from the beach but the hotel don't recommend it because of passing boats and provide hourly boats to take you snorkelling. It is not up to Red Sea standard but you do see fish. Ile Aux Cerf is a lovely day trip with BBQ lunch on the beach. You can snorkel with a surcharge.,Johannesburg| South Africa,01-10-16,Yes,5
Rest and Relaxation Deluxe ...,An incredible and memorable beach holiday...The sea-facing junior suite was a few meters from the beach. Waking up to the most wonderful views of the ocean and surrounded by rows of palm trees just added to a relaxing holiday. While garden units are available and may be cheaper| save up a little extra and spoil yourself with a sea-facing room. End you day with watching the most wonderful sunsets - either from the lounger on the beach or on the pool deck.The accommodation was very spacious and luxurious| the staff super helpful and friendly. Always ensuring that guests were happy and taken care of| nothing was too much trouble| anytime 24/7. The variety of amenities and activities available on the resort will keep every type of person happy while on vacation. Keeping fit while I was here was most enjoyable. Beautiful clean stretch of beach for an early morning run| beautiful pools| a hidden heated pool for that late night swim| big fitness centre and daily 5pm exercise classes. Spoil yourself with a treatment at the Clarins Spa. The 90min massage comes highly recommended. Ally was my therapist and he was and excellent therapist.Many restaurants to choose from but my favorites were the Indian & Thai meals. If you are foodie - you will not be disappointed but bookings are essentials at these restaurants. Buffet variety for breakfast| lunch and dinner is great and al carte is also available.I have to also give a special mention to Fatima| Dabby| Rakesh| Arwan| Jay and Ally. You display the art of guest centricit and hope that your management team recognises you for this.I will definitely be back :-) Thank you to all the staff at Beachcomber Trou Aux Biches Resort.,Johannesburg| South Africa,30-09-16,Yes,5
Beautiful hotel and kids friendly,This hotel is located in the best beach coastline of Mauritius. The hotel has lots of trees and greens and 5 pools -included 2 heated ones. The kids place is great with lots of space and a nice kids pool. The gym has a great outdoor Hammam place. The service is excellent and kids can pre order their food. One minus is too many golf carts driving around in the compound. The Asian buffet is the best. ,Triolet,29-09-16,Yes,4
Great Holiday,Nice beach resort for families with great water sports and a variety of restaurants. Luxury rooms and bathrooms. Lacks of night entertainment| but friendly staff in general. Restaurants could be closed as it gets very cold in the winter and windy time... But nicely laid out and overall very relaxing. ,Triolet,28-09-16,Yes,3
Impressive holiday retreat,I visited with friends and this being my first stay in Mauritius I had high expectations. Having visited several East Africa beach properties| I also had a benchmark on what to expect.We stayed for three nights in one of their beachfront villas. All rooms are quite spacious; the villas have the usual amenities as well as an enchanting private outdoor shower and a plunge pool. Rooms are clean with modern fittings. Staff are discrete and it felt as though fairies secretly kept the place clean throughout my stay.Guests are spoilt for choice on dining options with at least 6 restaurants (including 3 dedicated to Indian| Thai and Italian cuisine) to choose from without having to venture outside the property. Lots to do in and outside the property too. A functional spa for those wanting to relax. I also counted 5 swimming pools scattered across the property so there's no overcrowding. Properly equipped water sports centre as well as a tennis court and bicycles for hire. There's the clean long beach stretch without local vendors hustling you for those who enjoy leisurely walks. For a holiday resort they maintain an impressive gym. Finally the location is secure enough for an outdoor run along the beach or on paved roads that follow the coastline - I felt quite safe on a one-hour run starting 6am.I checked in slightly perturbed at the sheer number of guests milling around and wondering if service levels would be affected. This property exceeded my expectation and then some. I checked out determined to visit again one day soon.,Nairobi| Kenya,28-09-16,Yes,5
Vaccation in paradise ,When we arrived at the hotell we were recived by a serviceminded and friendly staff. Our room was not ready and we had our 7 months old son with us| so we were given complimentary drinks| fruit and were given a small room we could relax in after our long journey until our room was ready. We stayed in a tropical suite| both rainfall shower indoor and outdoor. Big main room with a bed and plenty of space both inside and on the balcony for our son to play on.The staff starting with the housekeeping/cleaners| were all fantastic. Kept our room spotless| came back every evening to change towels and check if we needed anything. The brought us a steriliser for our sons babybottles etc without us asking for it.The hotell has 6 restaurants| le deck (seafood)| L'oasis (buffet)| Caravell(International)| Corallo(Italian)| blue ginger(Thai) and indian restaurant.Le Deck: good food| very friendly staff| has the option for lunch but it was only mediocre and that was disapointing. Dinner was much better| has event night with forexample lobster evenings.L'oasis: buffet| and when you hear that word you think mediocre right away but no....very good food| has theme nightshift with indian| mexican and so on plus always some dishes present every evening| pasta and pizza. Fantastic staff.The Thai & indian restaurant: set meny but really good with fantastic flavours. Popular choices| so remeber to make reservations.Corallo: my favorite| because excellent staff| amazing food and good wine.Caravell: we were a little unlucky with the waiter one night and i had the impression that everything tok a little extra time and we had to wait before drinks and food showed up at the table.Breakfast is possible at L'oasis| Caravell and le deck. My favorite place was L'oasis. But i really have to give all the staff credit because of the way and the effort the put in to make my son feel good| it only took a couple of days before they knew his name| they made smoothies for breakfast and all the restaurants offered to make him dinner.The hotell has a (semi)private white sand beach| where again the staff goes out of their way to make your stay perfect. The boathouse has watersports like waterboards| wakeboards| waterskii and so on| pedalboats even sailingboats which are free at your disposal as a guest. The only minus at the beach is all the salesmen who are constantly trying to sell you something| that was really anoying in the long run. The reason why i wrote (semi) private is because the staff told me that the beach is at the hotells disposal but its still a public beach so they cant throw the salespeople away.The hotell has a spa section which my wife tells me is second to none.The hotell also has a diving center where Rajesh and colleges are running things. I tok my diving openwater licence and my wife took a test dive and these guys are really professionals and i would recommend this to everyone and say that diving is something you HAVE TO DO while staying in Mauritius. Swimming with beautiful corals| fish in all rainbow colours and turtles.No hotell or person is completely perfect| for ex: late service at one restaurant| anoying salesmen at the beach. But this hotell truly deserves 5 stars and we will be coming back. Highly recommended. ,Trondheim| Norway,25-09-16,Yes,5
Lovely family holiday!,Great place! We were there in 'Winter' but it was fantastic. We had a private Villa with 3 bedrooms| pool| butler and and and. It was just perfect. The Spa is very professional. The fitness classes are really good with very good trainers. The buffet is good| forget the Thai/Indian but the other two restaurants are really good( sorry forgot their names!). The staff do everything and anything to make your stay remarkable. We had a dentist emergency and appointments were made taxis ordered and the problem was solved!! The watersports club has all sorts of equipment available| all included in the price. Yes there are vendors on the beach because all beaches are public in Mauritius| but they are not a problem. All in all I can highly recommend this resort!!,Berlin| Germany,23-09-16,Yes,5
Quite simply the most magical| brilliant experience I've ever had,"Where to start? We visited Trou aux Biches in August 2016 to get married along with 23 other people. The place was simply incredible| the service impeccable and Mauritius itself is just wonderful.We arrived late at night but were welcomed with drinks and nibbles and shown to our room. The rooms are spacious (even the 'lower end' ones)| cleaned twice-daily and offers all the usual stuff e.g. iron/mini-bar/towels. The view from the balcony was beautiful. Outside our room| there is a communal pool that can be used by anyone within that 'block'| very quiet and useful if you want a more relaxed| peaceful time. The main complex itself is brilliant; the pool is large and with easily enough sunloungers for everyone there. The beach bar is excellent and waiters regularly pass by to take orders.As for activities| there is a lot to do. We spent a lot of the day playing tennis and table-tennis| and on other days used a lot of the free watersports you can do from just outside the hotel. We particularly enjoying Kayaking out into the ocean!In ten nights we never had one bad meal (breakfast| lunch and dinner) at the hotel. All of the restaurants we visited had impeccable service and the menu was extensive but not over-the-top. Drinks would| obviously| be fairly expensive if you are not on an on All-Inclusive package. We particularly liked the Thai and Indian restaurants.The wedding coordinator (Fiona) did a truly brilliant job of making our special day... special. She talked us through all the options we could have and was happy for us to ask any questions before the 'big day'. We got married on the beach and Fiona organised a brilliant local photographer to do our wedding photos - at an additional price. We then had a meal in a more private section of one of the restaurants which allowed us to do speeches and the like. All in all| a wonderful day that was perfectly managed.The hotel is quite simply the best place I've ever stayed. Fatima (the General Manager) did an incredible job of making sure we| along with the rest of our group| felt welcome and nothing ever seemed beyond them. Just little things like sending is a bottle of champagne on our arrival - due to it being our wedding - really made the holiday.If you are considering getting married at Trou aux Biches then feel free to get in touch; I'd recommend the hotel to anyone.One last thing - people say the weather in August can be poor. We were more than happy with it. The odd day was cloudy and cool but there is more than enough in Mauritius to keep you busy if this is the case. Other days it was high 20 degrees and in the sun felt even warmer. It's true what they say though: ""West is best."" the eastern side of the island is noticeably cooler.",Stourbridge| United Kingdom,20-09-16,Yes,5
Best hotel ever...,At first i would like to say| that all employed here are the best people i ever met! They are so kind| organized| they help you all the time| they would like to do anything for you... they work with heart.We had wedding there. It was like in most beautiful dream. It was better that i was expecting ...this hotel is worth every euro...I will come back for sure! Thank you 10000 times for best wedding ever :),Maribor| Slovenia,19-09-16,Yes,5
Vast hotel complex,Spend a couple of days in this hotel when I was on business on the island. I have to say| as a business traveler this is clearly not a hotel you should consider - it took my nearly 15 minutes to reach the parking from my room that was on the far end of the vast campus.On the other hand| the hotel looks great and the setting is beautiful. The staff is very attentive and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for vacation but not for business. ,Europe,19-09-16,Yes,4
Best holiday ever!!!,Well what can we say. The best hotel we have ever stayed in. We came here for our honeymoon on the 29th of August for 2 weeks.The people the hotel the location the food. This hotel has it all. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome| we were given a complementary upgrade on our room for the duration of our stay. The staff couldn't do more for you. The food was 5* quality. The breakfast selection was vast. The lunch options of 2 al a Carte restaurants or the buffet style was always varied and fresh. The evening options. 6 different places to choose from. Out favourite was the Indian. We went 5 times during our stay! The menu changed every 3 days there so always new things to try. All the restaurants were fantastic and each with a different theme. Dean from the customer relations was great. He showed us around the hotel and differ types of rooms or villas available and couldn't of been more helpful| Fatima the manager was lovely and always made a point of saying hello and check we were ok. The beach is a stones throw away and the beach boys were great always looking after us. The water facilities were great fun. All the beach staff took time to talk to us and advise us what was going on and if they spotted the regular turtle!Could not recommend this hotel enough. If you are looking for total comfort and relaxation then this is the place to go| will definitely be coming back.,Warsash,15-09-16,Yes,5
From aux niches resort and spa| Mauritius,We have just returned from our honeymoon at the resort and can not recommend it enough. From the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally| the resort is tranquil and luxurious| and the beach is beautiful. We will definitely return.,Triolet,11-09-16,Yes,5

Fantastic ,What a wonderful resort. Best beach and wonderful location. Thank you to Jerome and his team for the personal touch of making this trip so memorable. The staff are really polite and helpful and the resort is perfect to come and unwind and relax with lots of choice for food which is exquisite.,Roma,05-09-16,Yes,5
A great experience,I stayed at the Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa in August 2016. It has been an excellent experience: the location is amazing as well as the resort. The staff is very kind and professional.I truly recommend it.,Roma,04-09-16,Yes,5
Simply Paradise,Beautiful location| looks like I imagine paradise would look. Restaurants were superb| the food in them| the services the fantastic setting they were in made the dining out a real experience. I had 25th Wedding Anniversary there and renewed my marriage vows. Did this as surprise. Spa location| setup and treatments were the best we've ever had. The room| I was upgraded| was the beach front senior suite and again made me feel like a millionaire| simply superb in every respect. I added the drinks package on which was a good idea. couldn't have been any better.,Kingswinford| United Kingdom,01-09-16,Yes,5
Amazing place,We spent three nights pre a friends daughters wedding with a group of friends our experience was fantastic this is a great location on a great beachfront Fatima and Jerome were very hospitable I hosted my wife's birthday for 35 people at carAvelle it was executed excellently the ambience is very pretty service and staff is very good and the food was largely great the rooms are large with great outside showers rooms could be a little more modern compared to some of the other newer resorts overall we would choose this resort again highly recommended Sanjeev duggal India ,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,01-09-16,Yes,4
Beautiful resort in a tropical environment with awesome beachfront suites.,This was the second time we stayed in this hotel| this time we went for the Senior Beach Front suite which was totally worth it. Spacious deck to enjoy the beautiful sea view with a private pool below and very close to the beach too. Very friendly staff| great welcoming. Breakfast buffet is superb| be ready for a queue at the pancake stand ;) Very recommended hotel (we went with our 2 kids| age 7 and 9). We surely will come back again here! Lots of water sports/activities free of charge but also paying activities to be done (parasail| banana boat etc). Beautiful beach and you can go and see the dolphins very close (about 20 minutes by boat)| which was an awesome experience too| not like the overcrowded places most boats go to.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,31-08-16,Yes,5
Amazing Honeymoon!!,AMAZING OUTDOOR SHOWER| need a say more? I could not have dreamed of a better place to stay for my honeymoon and it was worth every cent. From the moment we entered| we felt welcomed and immediately relaxed with beautiful views from the reception. We were always greeted and assisted by friendly and helpful staff. The rooms were incredible| the beaches were stunning and all facilities were better than I could have asked for. The watersports were all inclusive with amazing snorkeling. There's something to do for everyone.I highly recommend this to everyone.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,29-08-16,Yes,5
Luxury on one of the best Mauritius beaches,This was my third stay in a luxury hotel in Mauritius and perhaps the best to date. The Troux Aux Biches beach is definitely the best beach I've seen on the West coast.Positives:- The hotel is in a superb position on a long| shallow| sandy beach| which is protected by a reef from big waves| and protected by its position from the strong trade winds that often batter the East coast.- The staff are lovely. Every one of them made eye contact and engaged. - The hotel grounds are spacious and lush. The pool is enormous and there were always plenty of beds available on the beach or by the pool| despite the hotel being at 100% occupancy.- The two-bedroom pool villa is enormous. It comes with a full kitchen which enabled us to shop and cook ourselves when we got bored with hotel food. It also comes with a butler who's on hand to do everything for you| from cooking breakfast| lunch and dinner in the villa| to cleaning up after you. Whether you find this a blessing or slightly annoying depends on you!- You can easily walk into Trou aux Biches (5 mins down the beach) where everything is cheaper than in the hotel and there are a couple of perfectly lovely local restaurants where food is delicious and very cheap. You can also take a taxi into Grand Baie for a little more excitement and diversity in terms of bars| cafes| restaurants and entertainment.Negatives: - There really aren't any serious ones so I'll nit-pick:- The food in the hotel restaurants could be more imaginative| especially for vegetarians. - The hotel beach can be accessed by the public| which means you're always being hounded by hawkers selling all sorts of souvenir tit-tat or| on the weekend| being eyed up by young men from the town walking past. Still| I didn't feel endangered| just slightly uncomfortable.- It's one hour and 15 mins drive from the airport on slow| windy roads| often stuck in traffic or behind trucks.All in all| a stay in the height of luxury| with easy access to real life| too.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,28-08-16,Yes,5
Super relaxing| gret service| good location,Great beach; great food and very friendly staff. The restaurants offer a great variety of cuisines. The beach is clean and exclusive and the pools are great. I also tried the spa and the treatments were great.,Zurich| Switzerland,23-08-16,Yes,5
Good hotel but spoilt by large conference,This was the second hotel in a two week|Two centre holiday and sadly it was a bit disappointing because they decided to accommodate a 230 group South African company conference here in a family resort.It was not what we had expected| 230 loud| drunken young people on a 5 day allPaid work jolly and although they weren't particularly rude or anything| it was intimidating having large groups of feral 20 + year old's taking over most of the beach and pools. Not great when you have little kids. The rooms were also disappointing. Our family suite only had two hard chairs and there was no sofa or anywhere comfortable to sit unless you wanted to sit outside on the small veranda which had outdoor furniture consisting of a table and 4 chairs and a sun lounger.The Thai and Indian restaurants were nice but I was left baffled by the fact that there was no a la Carte menu and we had to eat off a set menu.A bit disappointing compared to Le Paradis in Le Morne where we stayed the previous week.,London| United Kingdom,23-08-16,Yes,4
Service?,For a 5+* Hotel they offered really poor service. Food was horrible (cold| not tasty). There are way better 5* hotels on the island. We stayed 6 nights out of 15 in this hotel and we wanted to go back or move on to our 3rd location during our stay. On one morning there was a big fat rat in front of the breakfast venue. Jezzzz| not nice at all. and never seen before in a 5 * place. You only get want you want if you continue complaining all the time. And this not the way I want to spend my vacation. And: Don´t forget to ask for rooms which are not attached / or near the road. Otherwise you will feel like laying next to a highway.,Wollongong| Australia,23-08-16,Yes,2
Review is for Australian's visiting this resort,I will start by saying this resort is stunning| especially at night with all the lanterns lit up and the beach front is great to lounge around. We were in a junior suite room| the best part of the room was the bathroom but I have stayed in better looking rooms at a 5 star rating. We looked at the beachfront rooms but they don't offer privacy people walking along the beach can see in the room (curtains open of course) and the plunge pool isnt worth it when there is several pools onsite and a lovely beach. We traveled on half board but strongly recommend booking full board with drinks. Mauritius is expensive against the Australian dollars and even if you miss a lunch or 2 because you are out exploring it's the drinks that will cover you. A soft drink is $10Aus and a bottle of water is $6Aus an average cocktail $25++Aus and average wine by bottle $80++Aus we order room service our last day for lunch while we were packing and the burger was $35Aus. We picked this resort as it has several restaurants we could try but on arrival we found out that with half board there were only selected items we could pick from the menu otherwise you had to pay extra| so with that we just went to the buffet every night. Being a larger resort with a lot more guest the buffet is busy and every time we went (breakfast and dinner) our table we were sat at was never complete. Napkins| cutlery or glasses missing and you can spend a while waiting for it. I noticed other guest being vocal about it as well. The food is what you expect from a buffet. The service is good but nothing personal.They had some nice local bands playing to dance too. The resort is also great for families. We traveled as a couple mid August and had 3 warms days out of the 7 we were there but its there winter and can get very cool at night and windy.,Wollongong| Australia,22-08-16,Yes,4
Memorable time,A big thanks to Fatima Chuttoo| to Anwar and his team at l'Oasis and to Conchita as well as to the rest of the team at Trou aux Biches for the warm welcome and for making our stay extra special. The Mauritian night was so beautifully organised. We really enjoyed the food| the views| the spacious rooms| the heated pools. The service was excellent. Thanks to you all. Till next time! ,India,22-08-16,Yes,5
Excellent ,We've been to Mauritius a lot. This was one of the best all round hotels we've stayed in. The beach is excellent as is the accommodation although I didn't see people using their individual plunge pools at all. The best aspect is the quality of the food absolutely everywhere in the resort. We were half board for 15 nights so tried pretty much everything and it was faultless. I especially recommend La Caravelle and the Indian the name of which I forget.A few things to note When we arrived we couldn't book any restaurants as they were fully booked for our first 4 nights so we had to use the buffet. Not a problem when you're there for 15 nights but not good if you're there for 7. Book as soon as you can on arrival.The main bar area is oddly designed and the service surprisingly poor - compared with everywhere else. Wifi is great in the rooms and surprisingly on the beach but doesn't work in the bar or restaurants - great for some but occasionally you want to look something up over a meal but can't.Otherwise I highly recommend it and didn't see the children for 15 days as they were off playing permanently! ,India,17-08-16,Yes,4
one of the best beaches,have done a few trips at this resort. The hotel got totally remade and remodeled some 5 years ago. So that makes it one the newest Beach Comber Hotels. Stayed in the Senior Beachfront and beachfront suites. They are super spacious and the bathrooms are amazing. the beach is one of the best and we get some amazing sunsets. Food is really good with superb variety throughout the restaurants. Only thing was the Thai and Indian Restaurants opened for dinner only. The Chefs are amazing and they are very responsive to kids special requests. Would highly recommend it.,India,15-08-16,Yes,5
Awesome ,Was a incredibly beautiful place to stay. Very relaxed atmosphere. Free water sports the snorkelling was incredible. Was very clean place and so much beauty around the restaurants. Staff were lovely especially our new friend ritesh! We were made to feel very welcome| the food was brilliant in all restaurants I miss it already. Lots of swimming pools and easy access to beach. Taxi services available all day. We loved Mauritius and The 5 star resort :) ,London| United Kingdom,14-08-16,Yes,5
A lovely Hotel with nice facilities for family.,Enjoyed our stay there. It has nice long white sandy beach with a scenic restaurant on the beach. Also loved the kids and sports facilities. Staff were simply awesome| very attentive and your comfort and happiness is their prime focus. Well done.I also liked the idea of having some many pools which meant that you could get away from the main one if you wanted to.,London| United Kingdom,12-08-16,Yes,4
Mr. Yuekang,I've spent 7days at Trou aux biches| which has been a wonderful experience in my life. The decorations is typical tropical style as you can see from movies. People are nice and I felt at home from the beginning| and you don't have to worry about language problems if you don't even speak a bit of English| I've seen those staffs speaking good Chinese to Chinese customers. The facilities are really easy to access| you would be able to ask everything from your room| the services would be there in minutes. Speaking of food| there are Indian| Italian and Mauritian restaurants| we| most of time for dinner| chose the Italian one| i like the creamy gnocchi with some kind of nuts that tasted like almonds| and the basic one| pasta with tomatoes and basil sauce was good as well. You would love to do everything activity if you're good at water| even for the fresher like me| I had a lot of fun with my friends on the water.,Cape Town| South Africa,12-08-16,Yes,5
Lekker,Fantastic hotel and resort !!! very well located with great beach| restaurants and entertainment. Beachfront suites best in Mauritius. Only wine very| very expensive but otherwise as good as Mauritius has to offer.,Cape Town| South Africa,10-08-16,Yes,5
Relax and enjoy.,This was our third hotel in Mauritius and the best. From the entrance foyer to entering our room| it was clear that privacy| quality and the customer are a top priority. The bedrooms are spacious with large bathrooms and outside seating areas. Swimming pools are dotted around| near to all rooms but the beach is not far away. A variety of cuisines and restaurants mean that you have a good choice but be aware that all need booking apart from the buffet so find the folders at reception as soon as possible. There are also two bars to watch the stunning sunsets| both at either end of the lengthy beach and near to restaurants. A magical place to relax and unwind.,Dubai,09-08-16,Yes,5
Romantic holiday,Went for a short 5 days stay in this resort. First time in this location of the island. The drive takes around 1.5 hr from the airport| but it's definitely worth it! hotel has big territory| well maintained| has several restaurants and bars| beautiful beach and amazing service. Been in Mauritius before but this hotel is my favorite now. We took half board and we're happy with that| the breakfast was so delicious and had great variety especially fruits that it was enough for the whole day. The dinner was great as well and my favorite restaurant choice was by the beach all the way to the end of the hotel. The room we stayed had amazing garden shower and beautiful bath| just the best way of relaxation. The hotel has free water sport activity which really make ur day more active if u want to but otherwise laying by the beach or pool is also great.If u have a car| it's great to go and explore botanic gardens which re very close by| there is a shopping mall with big supermarket and golf place as well| also some nice bays around to go and have a drink or eat some seafood on sunset. absolutely loved our stay in this resort and definitely will come back soon there.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,05-08-16,Yes,5
Summer 2016,Perfect location| outstanding service.2 week stay.We did'nt appreciate Smoking| being permitted at the main entrance to the hotel lobby.Found the TV channel choice rather limited| to our expectations. OverallA fantastic family holiday We will be back ,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,03-08-16,Yes,4
Luxury and prime location,This is a fabulous property| and what ticks most boxes is the quality of accommodation| quality of food (6 restaurants - Main (buffet)| French / International| Italian| Indian (our favourite)| Thai & Seafood)| friendly staff| excellent beach amenities (Sports etc.|)| the sandy and daily cleaned beach| kids club| high quality gym and tennis courts and finally the location to other areas of the island for shopping and other attractions. It's the best location for decent weather in the Mauritius Winter (June - August). Being on the west coast means the wind comes from inland and is not so fierce and chilly| east coast locations beware. We stayed in a ground floor family suite (garden view) and it's perfect location close the reception| kids club| gym| pools - we had an additional shared (heated) pool surrounding our block of rooms - and restaurants. Our sizeable room was two bedroomed| so perfect for a family of four| with a special 'outside' shower that we all loved. We stayed half board and bought bargain (about GBP20 for a family of four) quality lunches from some local vendors along the beach in a public area| which was much cheaper than the average GBP80 you'd spend in the hotel. Drinks in hotel bar are London prices (it's a five star property). Our only critique is the buffet restaurant which is in need of updating after we spent one evening in the updated restaurant of the Beachcomber Paradis Hotel in Le Morne| and their new buffet is fantastic| with chefs cooking fresh dishes in six different areas. The main pool is not heated (a general feature we've found of all Beachcomber properties)| but other than that| it's a very hard hotel to fault. We'd certainly return.,Amersham,03-08-16,Yes,5
Successful luxury family holiday,We stayed in a villa in Trou aux Biches for two weeks in late July 2016. Overall we had a fantastic family holiday. The weather was as we expected - generally warm and sunny but the odd cloudy spell and occasional rain. Bring a cardigan for the evenings although you won't need it often. The hotel is well maintained on the whole| having been rebuilt about 6 years ago. I hope they continue to keep it up as the climate will add stress to the buildings and facilities. The restaurants were all good. Service was always friendly but not always speedy in one or two of them. The villa service was excellent. We were well looked after by the team and couldn't have asked for more. We made good use of the beach and the water sports facilities| including water skiing. One highlight was family yoga| which we enjoyed in our villa with Arun| one of the sports team. Arun will be moving to France in the near future to start a business with his wife. He is a wonderful young man and we wish him every success. The hotel will have to work hard to find someone better. We toured the island one day. The trip was interesting but we spent far too long in the car and too little time at the places we visited| which on the whole had been poorly developed for tourists and visitors. There is lots of development going on across the island and it does not look to be very well planned. I worry that the attractions of the island could be ruined through over-development in order to generate profits for Mauritius's elite and politically connected. Another highlight was a run in the Black River Gorge national park| which I organised via Yanature. You can find them online. They also arrange hiking and walking. If you want to get into the island's interior| it is well worth talking to them. Trails are not well marked or maintained so it is a good idea to have a guide. We ate out on only one evening| at a restaurant called Le Capitaine in Grand Baie. It was good but as others have noted on the restaurant's own review page| it is expensive. Final comment - the villa's are great. They are big and spacious and become very much like a home from home. Oh| and don't forget your bug spray. The mozzies are highly active here!,London| United Kingdom,01-08-16,Yes,5
Great resort,Spent two weeks here in July and had a great time. Very friendly and helpful staff and beautiful grounds. Lots of activities| watersports| tennis| diving etc. Thumbs up to James and the other guys at the PADI center. Recommend this resort to other families travelling with children of all ages.,Oslo| Norway,25-07-16,Yes,5
Holiday,The moment we arrived at the airport we felt comfortable and cared for| a private transfer| via taxi| was arranged to take us to the hotel. The driver was friendly and informative. At the hotel a team were prepared to meet and greet us with fresh fruit and a cool drink. The room was excellent| one or two hiccups but were swiftly dealt with. The gardens are beautiful and tended to| the hotel well run| pleasant staff| the food was good in the six restaurants| alcohol expensive| we found a local supermarket and bought some of the local rum. A great gym| which we used| and classes in the evening. Beautiful white sand beach. Fantastic water activities| we loved to go out beyond the reef on the boat and snorkel with the tropical fish. Water skiing| kayaking| paddle boarding. Visited the tea and rum factory and shopped in Port Louis during our 10 day stay| which was interesting. Loved Mauritus and most of the people we met were friendly. Overall a wonderful holiday.,Midlands,25-07-16,Yes,5
Very nice hotel let down by the food,"We stayed for a honeymoon week. We were graciously upgraded to a senior suite which we absolutely loved. The grounds of the resort are amazing| the beach is picture perfect| the staff is super nice.I decided to give 4/5 because of the restaurants: there are 6 restaurants on the grounds| 5 ""themed"" and one buffet-style. The themed restaurants were good (I would rank them Indian > international > seafood > Italian > Thai)| but the buffet one (which serves breakfast| lunch| and dinner) seemed sub-par.While the variety provided is excellent| the same can't be said for the quality: I feel that if they would cut down the number of dishes on offer and would focus on the quality and seasoning of the food the restaurant (and the resort) would be better off.Also| the price of beverages appears very high| at 200MUR for a local beer or 470MUR for a long drink.Overall a really lovely way to spend a week| but make sure you get bookings for the à la carte restaurants!",Brussels| Belgium,22-07-16,Yes,4
5* Paradise can be found here at Trou aux Biches,My daughter and I spent a superb 8 nights at the end of May 2016 in this delightful Beachcomber Hotel| simply divine. This isour 6th visit to Mauritius and our 4th Beachcomber hotel in 20 years as always Beachcombers standard remains excellent.The setting at Trou aux Biches is beautiful and practical| the staff as ever charming and helpful| the cuisine superb especially as I have to eat a bland meal the chefs were wonderful and very inventive. We were in a Beach front suite which was enormous and the view was glorious. We were a bit unlucky with the weather as they were experiencing the tail end of El Nino so the evenings were a little colder for this time of year. During the day it was lovely and we had a marvellous relaxing break together. It is also a bonus to be able to speak French with everyone| I was able to revive my once fluent French brilliantly! Mauritians are usually tri-lingual so English is no problem either.,Henley-on-Thames| United Kingdom,22-07-16,No,5
Exceeded Every Expectation,This is a fabulous hotel. This was my first trip to Mauritius| but after this stay| it will not be the last. The staff is absolutely terrific. They are all seriously dedicated to ensuring every guest has a great time. The property is beautiful and perfectly situated on a pristine beach. There are so many things to see and do in the hotel: tennis| swimming| snorkeling| spa| shopping| dining. I recommend getting the full board (Escape Package)| for it includes the use of any of the restaurants (and they have many). The room was spacious| comfortable| quiet| modern| and had a perfect tropical character. There is an outdoor shower| free wifi| complementary bottled water| and a fully stocked mini bar in the room. If you feel like doing more than hanging out at the hotel| the staff will help you book numerous sightseeing trips around the island. I highly recommend this fantastic hotel. You will not regret it!,Seattle| Washington,22-07-16,No,5
Excellent Hotel,This was our first trip to Mauritius and choosing a hotel wasn't easy but in the end we picked Trou Aux Biches and couldn't be happier. The resort is amazing| the rooms are really nice (a bit on the dark side| some extra lighting would be great) and the shower room is phenomenal!We had a 4 year old boy with us and one of the reasons we picked this hotel was because it has a Bob Marlene Kids Club. (We never ended up using it as all he wanted to do was build sand castles) but the detail and effort the hotel go through to please us was amazing. They even had a tiny little rob for him in the bathroom. The nights we didn't eat dinner at the hotel| the main restaurant would still accommodate dinner for the 4 year old at no extra charge. Honestly| the small thoughts that count that make the hotel that much better. The food at the main restaurant was different each night and the few times we ate there the food was fantastic. The Thai restaurant was great too| but its not cheap. But then again you are in a 5 start resort.The staff service is top notch. Unfortunately there was a down side to our trip and that is the in house PADI dive centre. They were very unclear about their charges and after we finished off our course they gave us a total that didn't add up. After much argument we ended up paying the total bill as it wasn't wrong| it was just very badly explained! It worked out twice as expensive as we had budgeted for. We have been to other PADI dive centres around the world and this one was by far the most disappointing. I would highly recommend if you want to dive| to dive with a centre outside the hotel.,Ahmedabad| India,20-07-16,Yes,4
Beautiful Property,I stayed for 4 nights for my honeymoon Pros Excellent propertyits a huge hotel with beautiful views green lush and awesome scenerygreat beach one of the best beach in Mauritius. At our time it was cold but excellent clean beach.Indian restaurant Mahiya is superb specially for Indians and vegetarians chief personally came and prepared food according to our needs excellent services.We stayed in tropical junior suite which had an amazing huge bathroom. Room was ok nothing special about it.CONS swimming pools temperature during winter they are not heated only one of them they told is heated in block 300 but that to not up to the mark. I had split my holiday in 2 hotels and right now I am staying in constance belle mare plage here swimming pool is heated to 28 degrees which i am able to feel and its comfortable but trou aux biches lack in that they have a beautiful swimming pool but if that was heated it would have been much better Main restaurants has lot of variety in dinner but as vegetarian they were very few it was difficult to find good veg food in buffet but for non veg its a feast.Room should have a couch or sofa something other than hard chairs.Finally Its a great Resort one of the most beautiful property..its green lush with lots of water bodies great views beautiful clean beach try to stay in blck 300 its near to everything. ,Ahmedabad| India,20-07-16,Yes,3
Two week holiday July 2016,I have never done a review before but on this occasion I thought I must. We have just returned from Tro Aux Biches Resort after a two week holiday. I can only say the whole experience was absolutely execellent in all areas. Staff| rooms| food| hotel| even the weather in winter was great too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone without hesitation. We stayed in a family suite| we were a group of three |parents and one 16 year old daughter| this worked out really well| the second bedroom / bathromm proving ideal. We also took the escape package which we were a little concerned about regarding what it included etc| particularly for lunch and dinner. We had nothing to worry about| it was more than adequate in all of the six restaurants and two bars.All in all a fantastic summer holiday| thanks to all of the excellent friendly efficient staff.,West Midlands| United Kingdom,19-07-16,Yes,5
Amazing resort and possibly the best customer care we have experienced,We have been coming to Mauritius for the last 15 years but this is the first time we stayed at Trau Aux Biches. The resort is amazing| the rooms are spacious and well kept. The customer service is second to none. I have had an incident on our arrival| which could have spoiled our holiday. The management| and Nicolas Julie in particular| made sure our holiday will be as good and upgraded our room and package| whilst making sure all is ok throughout our stay. The restaurants are of extremely good standard and the staff of La Caravelle in particular| go out of their way to spoil you. The Indian Restaurant actually gave us a cooking lesson when we asked how their dishes are made. Will come here again and again!!,London| United Kingdom,18-07-16,Yes,5
Nice resort,Our check in didn't go smoothly- no one was there to greet us| the check in was slow and full of errors (double payment| upgrade to fullboard was not put in system etc). We had two rooms and one of them had very unpleasant smell. It took 4 phone calls and 2.5 hours before anyone showed up to look into it which kept us in our rooms waiting. Feeling quite tired we lost our patience in the end since we had the feeling that no one really cared much about us. All in all we feel like reception was a very disorganized place? the upgrade to fullboard continued to be a bit of problem rest of week with staff continously asking which package we were on. They seem very confused about their own system.HOWEVER- after we complained we must say that the resort went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay rest of our week. In particular Manon at the Caravelle restaurant treated mrs. like a queen and he was outstanding. Most of the staff were lovely| but its a big resort so lacked a bit in the personal touches. Our 21 year old daughter unfortunately fell quite sick on one of our last days and may we applaud the hotel for their service in aiding us. Its never nice when you get sick a long way away from home| but they were so kind in arranging for doctors| taxis etc and would call us to ask how she was doing as she had to spend a night in the hospital in Port Louis. Thank you for your kindness.The rooms were amazing although a bit on the dark side. Our patio was facing north so never got any sun and therefore useless. However- we thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor shower and housekeeping did a great job in keeping everything clean and tidy. The pool outside our rooms was a bit sad. Really a beautiful pool| but theres no staff around and it feels a bit forgotten and empty. Also it was on the cold side brrr.The food was overall ok but not outstanding. Our two favorite eating places were the Indian and the Italian ones- by far the highest quality food. For breakfast we preferred the Caravelle- smaller and more personal service than the big one by the pool.Loved the bar in the evening next to the Caravelle - wonderful personal service and nice view. Diving was fantastic- great diving center with nice staff and many things to see right outside hotel reef (turtles| giant rays| moray eels and much more).All in all a nice stay but the resort is probably too big for our liking. It was only in the end of our stay that staff began to recognize us| and we like smaller hotels that makes you feel at home faster. But everyone is different and the advantage of a big resort is the many activities on offer.Again- thank you for the kind words and help in connection with our daughters illness.,Wassenaar| The Netherlands,17-07-16,Yes,4
Excellent hotel,Not many hotels are worthy of a 5 star| but this is a great hotel. Food was excellent most days. Rooms were huge and up to date. Staff very friendly| with levels of service I have only seen rarely. The location is on a good beach. Best to stay all inclusive if you can as bills can rack up quickly and unless you have a car eating out is not particularly easy. It is a huge hotel however reception wil;l take you to the other end on their golf buggies.,London,12-07-16,Yes,5
Greatest honey moon,The hotel was great!!! Everything was perfect!! We were on our honeymoon and got free massage at the spa which is a very nice place and calm. We also got free upgrade to half board. The food was very good!!!The only negative was that i got bitten by a jelly fish and that wad painfull!!The watersports are very good as well and u can do them for free. The bad thing is that boats get too close to the beach.We got the honeymoon suite and it was a very nice room in modern style.I would definetely return to this hotel,Paphos| Cyprus,08-07-16,Yes,5
Amazing resort with phenomenal staff,I travelled in June| stayed in a Junior Suite| on the Escape Package.We arrived at Trou aux Biches at around 2pm| and we were quickly greeted with fresh fruit and an iced tea| along with a warm and welcome smile from all of the staff. Perfect after our 12 hour flight. The check in procedure takes a little while| but there is a lot to take in since there is so much at the resort. We went back a couple of times throughout the stay just to check we'd remembered. The chap on the check in desk was amazing| very patient but quick at his duties. He suggested that we should run to lunch as it was closing.There are 5 restaurants and two bars at the resort| all of the restaurants| except the buffet require booking| as they're considerably smaller. This is a very easy process| just speak to the booking staff and you're all done! The restaurants all open 6/7 days| but the day off is different for each. We visited every restaurant| and the service in each is beyond amazing. Staff were so attentive| friendly and happy to help. My personal favourites were Blue Ginger and Corallo. Some of the restaurants offer tasting menus - the indian and thai| whereas the others are a la carte.The main bar at oasis is a slight let down| it suffers staffing cuts drastically throughout the day which can mean there are waits on drinks and the service doesn't match you receive elsewhere. Often the staff don't notice that you want more drinks| but as soon as you get up to walk to the bar| they will intercept you and prevent you placing an order at the bar. I would strongly recommend using the other bar at Caravelle| it's smaller| but extremely quiet. We spent many hours in there and the staff agreed the bar is quieter| so the drinks get more time to be made - so they're nicer.The resort offers sun beds on the beach - where there are hawkers| and sun beds raised on their own property| which is just above the beach| where the hawkers aren't allowed. They don't cause too much issue| they're not aggressive or pushy. The resort also has private pools for the clusters of suites. If you've got a spare 10 minutes| walk down to the pool in the 600s| and it has the big tree with the vines. If you're quiet| pop back at night as the photos are amazing - this is where they take some bridal photos!Overall| I think this resort is the best I've ever stayed in. The staff are amazing| after a few days the management staff will recognise you by name and greet you as such - what a perfect touch! The staff work very long hours| and it's a testament to them that they're so friendly and kind as to how much they must enjoy working here. I would personally like to thank Menon| Shyam and Stephen from la Caravelle| the maitre d of Corallo (the chap that remembers whole table orders without writing them down) and the waiter from Blue Ginger who made our time here that bit extra special| of course thanks to all of the staff!,Cuijk| The Netherlands,08-07-16,Yes,5
Wauw,Not one remark which is negativeFrom the moment we arrive till the moment we left we enjoyed the great hospitality and service if this hotel with its friendly staff!Suites are very nice although we do not really understand the meaning of the judge outside bathroom We would have loved to have a little bigger room instead of two bathrooms which cover more than 50% of the surface of our suite.Food in all the restaurant is of an excellent level As said together with great staff all sport facilities and gorgeous beach we had a perfect holidayA must visit !!,Cuijk| The Netherlands,05-07-16,Yes,5
Great Resort type hotel,"As soon as we arrived| we were efficiently greeted with a non alcoholic cocktail| they knew all our details and hence did not need to waste much time checking in| the reception staff took copies of our passports and handed our keys| and we were soon in a golf cart heading to our garden view rooms.Great rooms| decent sized| nice balcony| also outdoor shower| and all the general amenities in the room.The staff were all exceptionally amazing| the words ""No"" are not in their vocab| any request you make will be taken seriously and tried to be satisfied| and what I found pleasant was that if they forgot a particular item in our order| the wait staff have the decency to own up and apologize and fix the situation| btw this happened only once where the waiter forgot to put in our espresso orders.The hotel| the grounds| every thing is impeccable| and hassle free| the evening entertainment was light and appropriate. The food was all amazing| in any restaurant| we tried the Italian| thai and indian restaurant| i was particularly blown away by the service levels in the indian restaurant....| the staff there definitely need to be praised as they went above and beyond| and while we ate there was a Santoor player playing the instrument live| amazing.The only thing i would recommend is for them to have an alternative menu in the thai and indian restaurant that would cater to vegetarians.The wifi in the rooms was great| and there was a fine balance that there was no wifi near the pool or restaurants| only in rooms and reception.The water sports center was amazing| paddle boats| catamarans| kayaks| water skiing all is free| and glass bottom boat trips... The kids had a great time.The beach is ok| nothing to write home about| unfortunately it seems that there was considerable blasting done years ago that has destroyed a lot of coral| and the beach and ocean has lots of broken coral fragments which could hurt your feet. So it looks nice| but not as sandy as i would like.The hotel has a dive center| very professionally run| and they know what they are doing. All my dives were amazing| the only issue i have| is that if the dive center anticipates the people the equipment should be on the boat| clients should not be expected to carry the tanks onto the boat| or bring them back| no biggie| but that extra level of service would go a long way.There is nothing negative i can say about this place| except that know that this is not a boutique hotel| more of a large resort| but much better than several large resorts i have been to| and this comes down to the staff| each and everyone of them is amazingly trained| and intelligent| and will go out of their way for you... My hats off to all staff there and management. I will definitely go back :)",Johannesburg| South Africa,03-07-16,Yes,4
Lovely Stay,Wonderful property. Lovely white sand long beach. I stayed there for seven days. I booked this resort rooms with package of three days sightseeing. But once I reached there didn't go out even a single day. It was so nice and scenic. Fatima| the hotels very friendly manager| welcomed us. I used the spa and all free water sports every day. Unfortunately it was winter so couldn't swim too much| but the water sports were a perfect distraction. Enjoyed vegetarian food in all six restaurants. Very friendly staff. My room 103 and 104 were very nicely located. A perfect and a relaxed holiday I ever had. ,Mumbai| India,27-06-16,Yes,5
what relaxing it was,after one month of giving birth of twins wanted to spend 2 days with my wife to relax and found us back. The room was nice| the service was excellent and the food was divine. I absolutely don't regret my choice| it was calm and that was the best thing for relaxing and recharge our batteries. Will definitely go back.,Curepipe,26-06-16,Yes,5
Really 5 Star!!,Stayed at this property for 3 days and was really impressed with the beautiful property and the services which were top class..We stayed at the family suite. Two big bathrooms and tastefully decorated rooms.Beach of the hotel is great with good complimentary water activities Breakfast was good. The chef arranged good vegetarian Indian breakfast when he came to know that my wife was a veg.Nice concierge with smooth check in.Only suggestion don't be miserly on supplying mineral water bottles in the room.Overall great stay. Will recommend this resort to all,Cape Town Central| South Africa,26-06-16,Yes,5
Review for young families - June,I wanted to write a review of the Trou Aux Biches as this was our first long haul holiday from the UK with a pre schooler child and we took a long time to make the decision on where in the world to go. We know other people with kids find the decision making difficult too so thought a thorough review might be useful!UsWe are a family of 3 with one on the way (24 weeks pregnant at time of travel). Our Boy was 4 ¾ at time of travel| not yet started school. We have backpacked and shoestring travelled a lot before kids came along (Central America| North America| Africa| all over Asia| Australia| NZ| middle East| Northern Europe)| and so have high expectations of trips! The idea of going to a resort is very alien to us| all our big trips have been bespoke| pieced together from research and reading and have usually been long (4 weeks to multi month). The tripWe booked 13 days at Trou Aux Biches through British Airways as a ‘package’ (urgh!) so included all our flights from June 11th – June 24th 2016. ResortThe resort is run by beachcomber| a Mauritian Sugar company who have diversified (Im told) and operate a number of resorts across Mauritius. It employs <800 local Mauritians all of whom seem very happy to work there and live locally. It is spread out across 2 Km of a VERY pretty beach. The buildings are really nicely built| lots of thatch| lots of space| lots of water and LOTS of amazing tropical gardens. In June| the smells of flowers and sounds of birdsong filled the air every day. Roaming around the grounds with a 4 year old was brilliant| it felt like ‘the jungle’ to him and there was so much space to run and be loud it was really perfect and safe for him. Lots of open spaces to play| kick a ball| throw toys around etc. There were lots of families there| I would guess 30% of the guests we saw to be families. However| since the grounds are so large| it never felt like a noisy kids holiday| and in fact was very quiet. At this time of year most guests were French| south African or Asian. They seem to take security very seriously| every person coming in or out of the resort via the road has to give their name and car details| and since the resort doesn’t ‘own’ the beach| they station security people at the public ends to talk to people they don’t recognise as guests. This is stepped up at night but is in no way offensive or intrusive| with a child it made us feel reassured (having taken hairy buses across places like El Savador and Nicaragua we are fully aware that some places can make you feel less safe). You never really notice them| and they are really friendly. In general| for our first resort holiday| it dint feel oppressive| felt very lush and tropical and was a nice balance between feeling safe and relaxed and like we could explore & and mess around with our 4 year old. Every member of staff we met managed to remember our names| and especially our son's so every where he went he was greeted by name| with big smiles and big high fives. Even the guys at the beach club were 'his friends' after 2 weeks. BeachThe beach is THE selling point of the whole place. Amazingly a coral shelf makes the entire beach into a lagoon. This means the water is absolutely as flat as a pancake. I didn’t see a single wave over about ½ inch in 2 weeks. This means babies can sit on the waters edge| pre-schoolers can play in waist high water and bigger kids can walk a long way out and still only be in chest high water. The beach is essentially in two sides| either side of the main resort buildings. One side is a narrower beach| about 20 feet wide. This means you are about 6 paces from the water at all times and makes life easy for little kids running to and fro the water. Sun loungers are all made of wood and under thatch shade structures. The other side is wider and flatter| and spread out among hundreds of palm trees| so a bit more jungle beach feeling and shaded. A path runs along the back between the beach and the beachfront suites| meaning it only takes a few minutes to get around. The resort has golf carts (for the lazier or more pregnant of us! They also dont mind giving kids a ride a round on them!). Drinks are never more than a wave away from the guys on golf carts. The sand is white and fluffy (I assume high silica content?)| groomed every day| completely litter free and perfect for mega sandcastle building. There are outdoor shower all over the resort for cleaning your kids off! We spent 80% of our time on the beach| our son played really independently on the water’s edge building big sandcastles while we read and took turns playing with him| which was the perfect balance of spending time together and having some timeout to relax. The shade meant he never got too hot and the loungers gave him somewhere to chill out for some quiet time. The resorts beach club is brilliant. We used pretty much everything| and our 4 year old son has now tried water skiing (three times with kids club!)| catamaran sailing| paddle boarding| kayaking| giant peddlos| speed boat – all for free! Taking them out for 30 minutes at a time is great with little kids and is super easy to organise. PoolThe main pool sits on the waterfront| so you can lay on a sun lounger| between the pool and the sea| pretty nice! Youll have seen on the photos| it is cleverly designed| with as much shallow water as deep water| meaning kids and play and splash in knee deep water all day. There were never more than 2 people in the pool the whole time we were there! Again| lots of tropical landscaping all around which means lot of shade from trees and umbrellas. There are then 5 or 6 other pools| spread around the resort in amongst the main areas of accommodation. Im guessing at busier times of year this helps spread people out and keep it feeling peaceful and quiet. These have no shallow areas and are good for jumping and diving for kids. AccommodationWe were in a Tropical Garden Suite + which had a bed built in for the little one| but we were all in the same room. If we could have afforded it we would have loved a beach front exec suite| to us these looked the best option and would have saved on quite a bit of walking and getting thigs ready for the day as we could have popped in and out all day. The multi bedroom Villas were too tucked away| nearest to the road and furthest from the beach| so didn’t seem attractive to us. The rooms are huge though| and the bathrooms enormous. We had an outdoor ‘jungle shower’ which our little one loved every day. As people who’ve never used a resort before| it was great for the room to be tidied and cleaned every day| each night your beds are turned down while youre at dinner| fresh beach towels provided and lots of bottled water. So nice to no tidying for 2 weeks! We didn’t really use our garden balcony as by the time we had eaten dinner| put the little one down and relaxed we crashed ourselves (I didn’t go to bed later than 12.30 the whole time!). Also there were quite a lot of mosquitoes after about 17:00 and we always get badly bitten. Timing and WeatherFor us| this was an excellent time to visit. We were told the resort has 333 rooms and can hold 1000 guests| but was probably <1/3 full for the two weeks we were there. This meant nothing was busy or noisy| but I fear peak times would not be the same! Some of the people who work there told us they ‘run’ during busy months of the year and that sun loungers get people ‘reserving them’. I don’t think we would enjoy it anywhere as near as much during busy periods| we were told that from 1st July onwards the next busy period would start. We were able to wonder around at our own pace| sun bathe where we wanted| eat where we wanted| swim alone etc| it was genuinely really bliss. This took some careful planning between peak periods and also contributed to a much cheaper price it would seem. It meant we could take our little one before he started school in September| out of peak price season and before it was too late to fly pregnant. The weather was a risk as June is winter of course. Luckily| we had 11 days of perfect weather| and 2 days of cloud. On one of those days it rained| and so we went for a day trip on a local bus to the botanical gardens and the rain made it more fun. The rest of the time the weather was sunny| about 24-27 degrees. Every day would have some light fluffy (‘Simpsons’) clouds around. Maybe one of them would rain on you for 5 minutes| then clear and the sun would come back out. Im a weather worrier and it can stress me out if its not good| but I was genuinely amazed by how it couldn’t have really been more perfect. Not too hot for kids (meaning shade all day) not too cold| meaning its shorts and t shirts all day every day. It cooled down to about 17-20 at night| and we slept without air con. 26 degrees if my perfect temperature so I was very happy! We had to do the usual sun tan lotion on the little one and top up periodically but weren’t having to panic about him expiring in extreme heat. We had read a lot about wind at this time of year| and that was one of the main reasons to choose the North West coast – to avoid this. There was indeed a light breeze every day| but the resort is well designed and the buildings and foliage do a great job. We never found the wind annoying. Some days it would pick up in the afternoon| but generally it dropped in the afternoon| and more than half the days we had a brilliant afternoon of weather and clear blue skies for sunset. Kids clubWe’ve never used a kids club before so didn’t know what to expect. This was our little ones 35th flight but all previous trips with him have been city breaks in Europe| visiting friends apartments| skiing etc. The kids club was however excellent. Its laid out like a typical Nursery school here in the UK| with tables| toys| a stage| a big sandy area| a shallow play pool etc. The door has a bell and security locks and kids can if you want eat their meals there. Its staffed by lots of really lovely| friendly staff who speak many languages and seem to be great with kids. Every day there is a list of activities and they print out a 2 week schedule. Our little one typically chose 1 or two 45 minute activities a day| which he asked to go to and he ran there excited. We stayed in a Tropical suite in the 300’s which was nice and close| the club is in the middle of the resort| near reception. A few kids seemed to be there all day (10.30 – 19.30!) but the more common idea seemed to be what we did. Our boy did water skiing| face painting| henna tattoos| cookie making| that kind of thing| which gave us a couple of hours a day to relax. The only downside was our son was the only English speaker most days| and he didn't mange to make any friendships. FoodAs people who have never really used a resort| we wanted somewhere close to lots of real local options as well as more western options in the resorts restaurants. This wasnt really the case here. To summarise| the resort has 6 restaurants| which you can either include in your package (a bewildering array of package options) or pay for a la carte. We found it really annoying that we had to book for the restaurants every day| and were often told they were ‘fully booked’| although we understand that it helps with planning food and staff etc. We mostly ignored this and went to the restaurants anyway even when we were told they were full| and always ate where we wanted and in half full places. All the restaurants are very quiet| and you are expected to ‘dress for dinner’ – all very alien to us! The food is also very expensive (whether you take a package or not| its expensive!). All that said| the food is good| and our little one loved going to the Italian for pasta. Its was lovely to eat together as a family every day| just be prepared you cant eat before 19:00| so depending on your little ones age| you may have to adjust your routines a bit! We would arrive at 19:00 and managed to get the little one into bed for about 20:30 – 21:00 every night which was fine as he wasn’t waking up until 08:30 in the morning and meant family dinners every night which is what we wanted. We did eat out a few nights. Sakoa which is a 10 minute walk down the beach is another (much smaller resort) but welcomes you in and also has a bar right on the beach so is a good option to break the resort routine. Also| down in the town (a 20 minute walk along the beach plus a 5 minute walk on the (unlit) road) are 1974 and the Café International. These were both unfortunately closed when we tried to go there| but reviews of both are excellent. We also had a take away Pizza one night in the room from La Voglia Matta which was EXCELLENT pizza!We were only B&B so maybe that explains why we found it all a bit confusing and frustrating| so maybe our experience is isolated. Breakfast was brilliant though| and our son loved getting his pancakes made for him every morning| the waffles| the huge array of fruit| cereal| juices| etc were all a great way for us to all start the day sitting on the wooden deck in the sunshine. Out and aboutThere isn’t a HUGE cultural heritage in Mauritius| which we found different. Obviously the Island is essentially a sugar producing place| and human habitation has always centered around this with no indigenous heritage to speak of. So if youre used to rich Asian experiences etc you wont find that here. Its quite a built up Island| but to be honest wanted to relax on the beach| spend family time and enjoy some tropical weather| so this wasn’t our reason for visiting. However| we did visit the botanical gardens (really good)| the Sugar factory museum in Pamplemousse (also good). We took the local bus to both rather than taxis which was really fun for our little boy. We also hired a car and went to Casella for the day which was also very good for kids. One really good trip we managed to organise – we asked one of the beach hawkers selling 1 hour dolphin trips (which we never did) to take us to the local aquarium on his boat. This only cost 1200 rupees| took 30 minutes on the speed boat (we asked him to go extra slow the whole way!). We then clambered over some rocks and spent 1.5 hours at the little aquarium| which was a perfect little 1/2 day trip if you have a pre-schooler. AnnoyancesSo the list of things we didn’t like was actually very short. Hawkers – the beach isn’t private| we wouldn’t expect it to be| and we understand everyone needs to make a living| but hawkers the world over can be a little pushy. Here they are very friendly and mild| but there were quite a lot of them (expect to say no 10-20 times a day)Food – as I say| we found the idea of the ‘resort restaurants’ alien| and just wanted some nice Mauritian options on the sand like in Asia| no such thing around Trou Aux BichesBar – the resort bar is very sterile and not on the sand. Drinks are also expensive. It is crying out for a more fun option| on the beach for those of us who like a sunset beer| some music| a chat with the barman and maybe somewhere more fun to hang out that the hotel style bar on offer. I took to buying a beer at the local supermarket| and sitting on the end of the pier watching the sunset Mozzie nets – the rooms don’t have any mosquito protection. While they are a nuisance| we would have preferred to have the doors open| listen to the sound of birds| feel the warm breeze etc but we couldn’t as no mozzie nets in the rooms. SummarySo| I don’t know if this useful for any parent of young kids. Its our first proper tripadvisor review and we thought it might help people in the same situation as us trying to think of a nice tropical long haul holiday with a young family. Last thing| we made a point of asking BA at check in if we could have 4 seats on the aeroplane for the 3 of us – we had booked night flights. We got this in both directions| which meant our 4 year old was able to properly lay down| and he slept 8-9 hours both ways| and woke up fresh as a daisy. We were expecting to lose a few day of holiday to whinging through lack of sleep| but he found it a walk in the park and the 3 hour time difference from the UK meant we slipped straight into an easy routine – making Mauritius a good option for any UK based long haul family holidays!,Cape Town Central| South Africa,26-06-16,Yes,5
Wonderful stay,We stayed at Trou aux Biches fron 12 June 2016 till 16 June 2016 villa 508 close to the beach the villa was clean and well look after the big I mean big bed nice covered good block out curtains| in the bathroom you have everything you need but the outside shower is the best never used the one inside| the only draw back in the room would have been the bug killing mashines not working and one light dead in the bathroom| the resort it self is nicely looked after and cleaned the ground staff very friendly and helpful| breakfast| lunch and dinner were very good and well taste nice. You have to try this resort for a holiday.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,22-06-16,Yes,5
Beautiful location| lovely hotel,We stayed for a week in this hotel. We chose the senior suite beach apartment| so we had our own plunge pool and were next to the beach. The hotel stretches along the beach front| so is never crowded and finding free loungers was always easy. The room was spacious| large bedroom| large sitting room| spacious bathroom with big tub and indoor and outdoor shower. Well stocked mini bar and coffee machine. Outside decking area in the shade and in the sun next to the pool. Steps down to the pool area and beach. Excellent room service from the cleaning staff and turn down service. In fact all the staff we met were very friendly and happy to chat to us. The beach has hotel security staff as well as the sports team who offer many free and paid for activities. There are also hawkers along the beach| selling scarves and jewellery - really too many of them but they are friendly enough.Many restaurants in this hotel. We particularly enjoyed the Blue ginger thai restaurant where the chef devised us an enjoyable vegetarian menu. Incidentally| most of the restaurants have good vegetarian selections or they will make something acceptable to you. The main buffet restaurant also has veggie choices and I noticed at breakfast they provide soya and rice milk. Half board and full board residents can enjoy any restaurant by pre-booking at reception| so this provides a good choice.The main pool area seemed quiet| maybe this was because the weather was only about 24 degrees| so the cold pool was not so inviting as it would have been in hotter weather. As we had chosen a beach side room we were more than happy to sit on the beach or by our own pool.The hotel is quite spread out| as a positive this gives you a lot of privacy| at night it does mean walking along dimly lit paths to the restaurants and bars.A lovely hotel that I would be happy to revisit.,Mauritius,21-06-16,Yes,5
Birthday Celebration!,I spent two nights there with my husband for my birthday. We booked a junior suite but were given a family suite which has a massive bathroom and an outdoor shower. We had dinner at the main restaurant (buffet) - Good variety on both nights and excellent food. I was given a lovely birthday cake. A nice birthday getaway :),Mauritius,19-06-16,Yes,5
Totally worth it,The best place for honeymoon. We spend 10 days there. We absolutely recommend Mauritius and Trou aux beaitches- great apartments| amazing food. The staff is very polite and helpful. The beach is beautiful and clean|,Triolet,17-06-16,Yes,5
June 2016 Review,"Arrival wasn't great| had ordered birthday cake for my wife which never arrived. Was told that we needed to come back next morning for full orientation of resort. Room (garden suite) was excellent| very spacious with lovely bathroom and shower area and terrace looking onto gardens. There was a massive (banyan) tree outside which was very beautiful but housed well over a thousand (common myna) birds. These birds never seemed to sleep and screeched all through the night - it didn't bother us but if you are a light sleeper then make sure you request to be far away. Wifi in room was very strong throughout stay.The beach is lovely| large and nice sand. Swimming was great inside designated areas but the coral close to beach is dead so few fish. Outside the designated areas| swimming is ""at your own risk""| there are more fish but boats come past so you need to be careful. At this time of the year (June)| water temp is around 25 degrees - it's a little cold for most. We wore short 2mm wetsuits which made all the difference. There were plenty of complimentary water sports available. At this time of year| we recommend staying on north or west side of island as weather is usually warmer / less windy so hotel location is excellent.Food was ok - nice breakfast with lovely setting looking over sea. Staff were always courteous and genuinely pleasant. We had amazing crab one night at the main buffet| we liked the creole/French restaurant| the Italian was more bland| the fish bar was average. Cheapest wine was MRP 300 ~ GBP 6 per glass.Facilities were excellent| loads of tennis courts and a nice area for badminton| table tennis etc...Check out was a let down - got passed around from one person to another and were given incorrect information on currency payment. We weren't asked how our stay was which was unusual for 5*. It's a shame as with this exception| the staff were excellent.On the whole| we had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend Trou Aux Biches.",Dubai| United Arab Emirates,15-06-16,Yes,4

Simply perfect,If you are planning for the perfect holiday experience| you simply have to book at the Beachcomber Trou aux Biches.

Beautiful 5 Star Resort,Just arrived back from a 10 night holiday at this resort| what a wonderful place to stay| we are 2 Adults and 2 Children and stayed in a family suite| all the crescents are fantastic with there own pool| the main pool was idyllic with amazing views over the beautiful Indian Ocean. We were on BB but upgraded to Half Board| we tried all the restaurants and couldn't fault any of them| our favourite was the Thai| Blue ginger. There was plenty of free water sports to enjoy from the boat house on the beach| tennis courts were great. Watching the sunset in the evenings was absolutely awesome. We loved our holiday and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this resort.,Kettering,07-06-16,Yes,5

Fantastic stay for all the family,Five stars all the way. Great staff| amazing chalet style accommodation with 2 large rooms| 2 ensuites and even an outside shower. Plenty of room for a family of 5 (kids 12| 9| 6). Plenty of swimming pools on tap. You do need to secure your beds on the beach early which is a pain| but the staff will help if you're late to the party. Place felt very safe and OK for kids to run around. Tips: book you're restaurants well in advance as they fill up fast;if you want to play tennis you can only book on the day and if you want to play between 4-7pm you'll need to book as soon as you wake up!The waterski guys are great - v patient and basically taught my daughter to waterski. If you go when everyone else is troughing on lunch you'll have the place to yourself;Dolphin tour great for the kids. Lunch bit ok - we had a good crew| otherwise could be painful;Island tour| although interesting| is no great shakes. Don't bother with the giant turtles as they'll be static and hiding in their shells;Plenty of beach hawkers to barter with should you want. Thoroughly enjoyed by all the family,London| United Kingdom,05-06-16,Yes,5

Idyllic exotic location for couples looking for romantic retreat and lots of activities nearby,This holiday was to celebrate a wedding anniversary and was nearly better than the honeymoon. The resort is in a stunning location and is a development that feels spacious and airy in the lobby which is more of a canopy with minimal walls so the guest experience flows smoothly from 'inside' to the garden. There are a few boutiques in the lobby area. There is a choice of rooms either inside the main hotel or with private villas along the beach with their own plunge pools. We stayed in the main hotel rooms which were comfortable and spacious. We thoroughly enjoyed using an outside rain shower. Each day it was only a short walk to breakfast or to the beach. Buggys could be ordered to reach the far side of the resort. We went during rainy season and there were golf umbrellas and verrandas for occasional showers so they did not disturb for long. Most of the time it was bright sunshine. Buffet breakfast and lunch are served in the main hotel and the food was basic but fresh and plentiful. Service was good. We took option for breakfast and evening meal and had lunch elsewhere when exploring the island. For that package you need to be savvy about reservation for your evening meal as some restaurants get more booked up than others. The restaurants operate very differently so it feels as if they are managed separately and service varies also. We attended a weekly event in the breakfast room when hotel staff host a tasting menu of traditional Mauritian food and highly recommend the experience and the chance to meet them. There was all types of stalls offering street food you would find in the markets.Most of the guests were couples who seemed keen for privacy. The majority of the families had lively happy children that were a pleasure to be around many staying in beach villas. European families with small children seemed to eat earlier in the evening. The only thing which was negative on the holiday was one family with screaming toddlers who were oblivious to the disruption they caused to the atmosphere at the peak time when the honeymoon couples wanted to enjoy dinner in the different restaurants. The picturesque swimming pool is popular with guests and well-stocked with sun loungers with waiter service. There is a long| very private beach which is stunning and well-groomed just like a postcard with plenty of loungers as well. The keen swimmer would need to use the sea as the pool is quite shallow. A shark net encloses the beach and there are lifeguards. You can take a walk for more than an hour along the beach and some of the hotel’s other restaurants are situated along this stretch. Friendly local vendors sell trinkets on the beach. There are several water activities to experience like kayaking| windsurfing and catamarans and lots of guests participated. There is a covered jetty where sightseeing boats are moored and it is used for wedding services. We had a wonderful time on day trips with a local taxi visiting the capital city and had a meal by the harbor. We also went to a sugar refinery and to buy ships in bottles which are a local export. I went on 2 quad biking expeditions. The highlight for us was having bouillibaise lunch in a café at the far side of Trou au Biche run by local Mauritians that was recommended by the taxi. This is one resort we will definitely return to many times.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,29-05-16,Yes,4
Relaxing and Enjoyable for the whole family!,We stayed there for 9 days. I Have two children aged 6 and 3. We all enjoyed it and came back refreshed and relax| thank you Trou Aux Biches RS! Excellent value for money and one of the most friendliest hotel staff we have met.,Islamabad,25-05-16,Yes,5
Amazing Hotel,Beautiful hotel set in the most amazing gardens and on a fabulous beach. We stayed in a Superior room with own pool) We are a family of three with an 8 year old daughter. Fantastic to be able to go from the beach to our own pool back to the beach etc. The kids club offered fantastic activities for the kids - cooking classes| modeling show| aquarium visit| pizza making party - my daughter loved it. The food was excellent and we never had a bad meal. The service could be better but with it being such a large resort I think it is expected on the odd occasion. Special mention of Oumesh at the main bar - fantastic barman/waiter who truly made our trip that much more special. Thank you OumeshOverall an wonderful stay. ,Chingola| Zambia,24-05-16,Yes,5
Great hotel with special atmosphere,Stayed at the hotel in Feb2016. It was love at first sight! We got a warm welcome from the hotel staff right after we arrived. We couldnt check-in to the room earlier so we decided to go to the beach| which was pretty amazing! Long| white sand and blue ocean..I bought some pineapples from a native- Rambo Vitamin (very funny and nice guy) - definitely the best pineapple in the world.. Our room- junior suite was in the beautiful garden full of palms| very private| enough space and big terrace. Even though the hotel was fully booked it didnt feel like it at all! Food was great| breakfast had many options - sweet| fried| eggs| fruit| vegetables.. Everything was simply amazing!,Durban| South Africa,22-05-16,Yes,5
Wow!,My Husband and I stayed here recently for our honeymoon and it was the most incredible hotel we have ever stayed in. The hotel is so beautiful and the rooms were spectacular and well maintained. There was plenty of restaurants to eat from at the hotel and the food was always delicious. Would defiantly recommend paying for the full package where all your meals are included as there weren't any other places to eat close by. Defiantly worth the 5 stars was an incredible resort.,Durban| South Africa,20-05-16,Yes,5
5 star hotel with 10 star service and facilities,This hotel is without fault.It is in a perfect location rooms are spacious and comfortableThe food is fantastic and lots of restaurants to choose from. The service from all the staff exceeds expectations and you can just while away your days in comfort on the beach.,Durban| South Africa,19-05-16,Yes,5
Beachcomber Trou aux biches mauritius,I have to say that the hotel is lovely. Very well kept. I booked a senior room with private pool. Couldn't have asked for a better room. It's one of the loveliest hotels I have been and the staff are really nice and helpful. The only downfall is the service at the buffet restaurants. Morning's at the l'oasis was terrible as if you were really really lucky you could get a waiter to serve you warm coffee. And if you were really lucky 'with milk'. After the first few days we decided to change to la caravel for breakfast. This Restaurant was better but still service was poor. However| the sit down restaurants at dinner I have to say were superb. Overall food was to a high standard.,Gibraltar,18-05-16,Yes,4
Holiday of a lifetime!,This is a wonderful place to stay. This was our second visit to Mauritius and our first at this resort. We had one of the suites with a pool. Such a comfortable| quiet place in August of last year. Staff are exceptional in their friendliness and service - nothing is too much trouble. I got a nasty chest cough whilst there| and the waiter at the restaurant brought me lemongrass and ginger tea every day| his decision. So very kind. Being Australian the weather was not quite warm enough for swimming or water sports| but we found the place so relaxing and comfortable that it didn't matter. I would go back to this resort in a flash| but for me it would have to be in the warmer months.,Perth Hills| Australia,17-05-16,Yes,5
Wow,Absolutely stunning hotel. Rooms are great| gardens are beautiful and staff very very helpful and super friendly. Easy transport available on the hotel grounds| but better to walk and soak in the tranquility of the landscaped gardens. Variety of restaurants to choose from and the food is excellent. Gym is well equipped and the spa is great.Beach is superb and water-sports available at no additional cost. Not much more you can ask for!,Johannesburg| South Africa,17-05-16,Yes,5
Beautiful hotel & Beach,Visited here September 2015 whilst attending a wedding. The rooms were beautiful| very clean| well designed and very spacious with a tropical shower. Perfect location and friendly staff. The beach was a stunning long strip. The only tiny downfall I have to say about this place is that I did find the food was fairly average. Also as it was buffet style set out in open surroundings| this meant it lacked in food hygiene and birds were flying around. Other than that I would say this resort is next to perfect. ,Wolverhampton| United Kingdom,17-05-16,Yes,4
artificial but really nice,I spent a week while attending a congress. It is a beautiful place| with good rooms (a bit dark| but the I loved the patio and outdoor shower)| plenty of pools and a lovely beach. The service and food is good and the activities okay. A romantic place to stay if you are not interested in doing more than relaxing. Nature is beautiful in Mauritius but I did not find any interesting local culture| not even an authentic restaurant that does not cater to tourists only.,Ferrara| Italy,17-05-16,Yes,5
Amazing,You will feel like in paradise. We had beachfront suit with pool so we could see the sea from our bed| it was breathtaking| food is delicious| all the service is perfect. Its heaven| you cant be disappointed.,Liege| Belgium,16-05-16,Yes,5
Hotel| beach and the island are beautiful,Very nice venue in a beautiful park facing one of the most beautiful beach on the island. The hotel architecture is very far from usual block hotels by being designed like traditional houses in a luxuriant jungle. But it's definitely the kindness of people from Mauritius that will make you love the island.,Liege| Belgium,13-05-16,No,5
Beautiful hotel on a lovely stretch of the beach,"I stayed here for three days for a conference. The rooms are beautiful - each set of 10 or so share a pool area| but they are all hidden away in the gardens so each seems very private. The beach is lovely with very polite (and not remotely persistent) beach vendors. The bathrooms are amazing - very large with a large bath| wet room area and another (private) outdoor shower surrounded by jungle plants. The only downsides are the room service (or at least what I had) was really not nice (a cheese toastie was made with ""plastic"" cheese and quite nasty) and generally service is very slow (this may have reflected that I was at a conference so in business mode; had I been on holiday I may not have noticed how long it took to get served). I would certainly go back on holiday| but would eat in the restaurants| not my room. The location is also good - there are some shops/restaurants that you can walk to along the beach or roads| unlike many of the more exclusive hotels that are a bit isolated. Also the gym is very good. There is very good wifi (it works throughout the hotel including the beach).",London| United Kingdom,12-05-16,Yes,4
Exceeded expectations!,Spent 10 days here for some R&R| after reading the reviews before travelling I am delighted to say that it exceeded our expectations. Very well appointed hotel and rooms| lovely big cumfy bed. Nice gardens and pools. A great beach area and lovely sea to swim and cool off in. We preferred the buffet to the restaurants with the themed food evenings there was always something different to try. The restaurant staff in general could have been a little friendlier. It was a shame the drinks were so expensive £10 for a G&T but handy there was a shop 10 mins walk down the road. I always think it is a shame that the spa is so expensive for treatments surely they would be busier if the prices were a little cheaper| its the same everywhere you travel though and not a dig at this hotel. The hotel manager made her self known and often found patrolling around to check guests were happy| nice touch we thought!,Hythe,09-05-16,Yes,4
WONDERFUL,A girlfriend and I just got back today after 10 days at this wonderful resort.The hotel was packed but the service| food|friendly faces never changed and it has to be one of the loveliest places we have ever stayed at.The food was outstanding especially at Le Oasis.The seafood buffet night was fantastic and we ate there several times.Yes there are mossies but every where has them and with repellant dont bother anyone.The hawkers on the beach are lovely to talk to and leave you alone if you aren|t interested.They were all concerned about me when I was sick for a couple of days and came up to my friend on the beach every time to ask how I was.Many thanks also to Nitin our taxi driver from the hotel who we used as he was cheaper than the ones outside.You can reach him at nitleck@hotmail.com and he will take you all over the island at a reasonable price.,perth australia,04-05-16,Yes,5
Lovely Hotel but poor dining experience,My wife and i stayed in a lovely garden suite| from Sunday to Thursday morning everything was brilliant however from Thursday the service in the restaurants deteriorated we tried the Italian restaurant on thursday evening and it took almost 15 minutes for somebody to provide us with a menu and take our order. On saterday night dinner at the Deck was even worse | after 75 minutes my main course was eventually served Ice Cold. What a terrible disappointment. Checking out on Sunday was worse as i was loaded with over 2000Murs of somebody elses bill.,George| South Africa,02-05-16,Yes,3
Outstanding,I just want to thank everyone at Trou aux Biches Hotel for making our stay outstanding!! From all your friendly faces to the delicious food| comfort and just such an idyllic resort:) If it was not for you| your our honeymoon would have not been the same.Thank you Fatima for ALL YOU DID for US :) You are AMAZING!!I highly recommend this paradise .....,Johannesburg| South Africa,01-05-16,Yes,5
You are in a tropical country - expect bugs - get over it!,We stayed at the resort for 10 days and had the pleasure of being married here. As such| we experienced 3 room types because we upgraded our room after the wedding. Junior suite - nice| smaller living space| nice big bathroom and outside shower. No real views from your balcony. Room 235.Garden suite - larger living space| equally large bathroom and outdoor shower. Nice view of the gardens and the tree featured in the wedding photos on the website. 30 second walk to small pool. Lovely room. Room 643.Senior beachfront suite - stunning room. Large living space and separate bedroom. Nice big freestanding bath. Outdoor shower. 30 second walk from your private splash pool to the beach. Room 656.Ignore the reviews about bugs. They do fogging weekly so they aren't so bad. But put it into perspective| you are in the tropics so you get bugs and geckos. Yes there are birds flying around at breakfast. Just get a table inside.Staff were really friendly.We found the food to be very good. Yes| it is pricey| but you expect it when in a 5 star resort. If you are half board| breakfast and dinner are free if you have buffet in l'oasis. Which we found to be if a good quality and had a different theme every night. The good thing is if you have half board you can eat in the other restaurants from a restricted menu or pay a small supplement for the full menu.The wedding was great. All taken care of by the organiser (Fiona). She was wonderful. Everything was relaxed and taken care of. FYI if you are a control freak| this may not be your thing. However if you want an easy life| it is right up your street!Wifi in rooms and reception was really good.It's a great resort. Loved it.,London| United Kingdom,30-04-16,Yes,5
Not a 5+ Star experience!!,"This hotel has much going for it in the way of accommodation- the rooms/villas are lovely although have some annoying elements such as silly reading lamps (like the ones in business class on an international flight - fine for on a plane - not so much for reading before bed) and no bedside tables to speak of - very ""designer"" but not so user friendly. Lovely bathroom with outside shower was a bonus. Each cluster of rooms has a large pool which was exceedingly pleasant to use - however mosquitos did become an annoyance. The beach was lovely and what we were after on this holiday.The food & service in the restaurants were seriously lacking - except for in the Indian & Thai restaurants where both were excellent. The Italian restaurant and The Deck restaurants for dinner were frustrating - service is NOT top notch as it should be in a 5*+ hotel. People generally arrive at much the same time and staff could not cope with a decided lack of menus and flustered staff. Food in Italian was good but cold ribeye steak and potato bake for dinner at The Deck on our last night really annoyed us! Often at Breakfast tables were not set up properly with serviettes| spoons etc missing. On more then one occasion no plates were available with patrons all hanging around waiting!!We have stayed in many 5* hotels in Mauritius - this one will not be visited by us again!",George| South Africa,30-04-16,Yes,3
Gentle easy holiday,Hotel staff pleasant and all very happy to assist at all times. Sports instructors very up to date and the hotel is the perfect place to relax and enjoy what the island has to offer. Grand Baie shopping and Vida cafe coffee very pleasant. Very well worth the effort to leave the resort hotel and meander around to find the perfect little 'caravan' offering deliciously prepared loca curry!! Our favorite meal was to be found there.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,30-04-16,Yes,5
Best holiday,Stayed at the hotel from the 7-13 April and it was absolutely beautiful. The service all round from the reception| restaurants to the pool was perfect. I couldn't figure out why some people say they had the miserable experience yet everything we ask for was done that same time. Will gladly go back to the hotel next time,Zurich| Switzerland,29-04-16,Yes,5
Awsome holidays,"The hotel is located not so far from other cities which is nice if you want to go shopping. The pool is amazing| only the beach is a bit ""boring"". At first we had to wait to get our room and then they excused themselves and also moved us closer to the main building and pool| which is more convenient with out 2 years old daughter. Service was excellent and so was food at the buffet as well as in the restaurants. Rooms were clean and big. Would definitely recommend.",Zurich| Switzerland,27-04-16,Yes,5
save your time| nerves| money and go somewhere else,We have stayed there for 6 days. It is a very nice resort with spacious and well-designed rooms| beautiful garden and beautiful beach. Unfortunately| service and management concept in general are catastrophic (I have stayed in many luxury hotels and resorts| also in few 3 and 4*| but I think this stay made my experience the most disastrous). I really wonder how it could get 5-and-a-half-star rating. To be correct regarding services – cleaning was perfect| most of staff in restaurants and bars usually have tried to do their best (although have not always succeeded). The worst experience were mosquitos and food. There are a lot of plants| what is perfect. But it requires regular insecticide spraying in the area| at least this is how it works in other luxury resorts with dense vegetation. Mosquitos were everywhere in large quantities and even the locally bought spray has not helped a lot (forget about staying in balcony/terrace in the evening). Food was really poor regarding both quality and a choice (except the breakfast| although no sparkling wine as it is usually offered in such resorts). In similar places| there is always a good offer based on the fresh food| catch of the day etc. here it seems they have pre-processed (probably frozen) food| because they have never been able to change ingredients – with arguments “it has been already marinated/prepared for cooking” etc. there is a buffet concept in restaurant with always the same (or little changed) overpriced menu| really annoying. Definitely not a 5* cuisine – overcooked sushi rice| over salted fish| etc. Hygiene is also very doubtful in the restaurants – there are plenty of birds eating from tables during the breakfast and lunch. Many of them apparently ill| with deformed paws| but happily making excrements on chairs etc. staff just swipe it off| no disinfection seen there. Imagine your little baby touching all furniture around and then eating food by hands… A la carte menu and prices are a different story – I have never seen so strange price calculation. Mozzarella (small to medium sized) with one sliced tomato and some oil costs cca 19 EUR. Lamb cutlets with vegetables (quite a big portion) costs cca 30 EUR. Price for lamb is ok| but for mozzarella with one tomato and little olive oil definitely not. The same goes for all salads| appetizers – price calculation is inadequate. And no warm/cooked food available after 15:00 until dinner (19:00?) – just few overpriced salads and two sorts of ice cream. And chips. Drinking in the bars – forget the 5* experience| it’s rather a sea side canteen. As appetizer they serve just a small jar of peanuts Wifi was more not-working then working| no matter of the area. After the sunset the resort becomes a dark hollow with minimum lights and fast riding golf carts| so rather don’t risk a walk in the evening. Hotel beach does not look like a private one| there are many people passing by| including many annoying salesmen. I also don t understand| how the hotel management allows so many boats (small and old boats offering waterskiing| trips etc.| but not belonging to the hotel) to ride along the hotel beach – there is a constant engine smell and a noise and thus a very limited space to swim... The idea to change towels and offer other services in the evening by room service coming without a prior notice or call is really disturbing. I feel very sorry for all honeymooners ;-) By the way - unlike the other Beachcomber hotels| this one does not make customer satisfaction survey after departure - a coincidence? ;-) Last but not least| the resort has a huge potential| but needs substantial changes and improvement in concept| services and management.,Partyslava,25-04-16,Yes,2
Hard to imagine better for a couple with a small child or children,"We took our three year old daughter here and were all treated royally| to fine amenities| service| dining and sun/play activities. There were a lot of children about| but to me (who has one| so biased!) I never felt as though they were taking over the place. The resort was truly held to a high standard| and we met some lovely couples/families. We were happy to have not taken the full or half board options| because the breakfast buffet| though not bad| was lacking compared to the excellent food on offer| particularly at the Thai and Italian restaurants. Great beach| with plenty of loungers| though this was less the case at the pool. Great position on the island. We loved our side trips to Casela| the aquarium nearby| and on the resort's speed boat to swim with the dolphins. Didn't try the spa but heard from fellow guests it was good. We felt secure leaving our daughter at the kids club| which was great to have on site| as were the tennis courts and ping pong tables. Twice daily cleaning of room (we had a room with outdoor ""tropical"" shower) appreciated. The room wasn't 5-star Asia stunning| yet hard to fault. Overall we were very| very pleased with the hotel and if we're back in Mauritius anytime soon we'll not hesitate to go back to Trou aux Biches.",hong kong,24-04-16,Yes,5
Simply perfection! Stunning hotel| blissful relaxation| I will be back with my family for sure,I am currently staying at Trou aux biches resort and spa. I have stayed in a lot of five star hotels around the world so I'm hard to please and there are very few I would return to after visiting. I am absolutely loving it here! Meeting the manager on my arrival day was a nice personal touch. All the staff were courteous and friendly. You get the standard cold towel| drink and fruit.Trou aux biches is a large resort comprising of several groups of villas. The villas are set in manicured tropical gardens. Each area of villas has its own pool. However| there is also an incredibly large pool between the beach and reception which is surrounded by Palm trees| from here you can watch the most stunning panoramic sunsets. To get round the resort you can walk or be driven around in buggies which are always available from your room or reception| I never really waited. There are six restaurants to choose from| one is the buffet restaurant called l'oasis| there was a wide choice of tasty meals on the one night I ate there| I certainly stuffed my face and made use of the chocolate fountain! I booked out my week of dining on the first day and was easily booked into an a la carte restaurant every night. All the meals I had were very tasty. The staff are superb| very friendly and I was never ignored at meal times. My room was huge with a balcony area| inside the room was modern and clean| not dark and damp| as is suggested by some reviews. My towels were changed daily and fresh fruit delivered. The beach front pool rooms I saw were really amazing. I wished I had booked one. Trou aux biches beach itself is just beautiful. Powder white sand| no seaweed| lapped by a gentle turquoise ocean. The hotel offers a wide variety of free water sports and glass bottom boat rides three times a day. There were quite a few kids playing in the main pool| there usually is during school holidays. At night the hotel is cleverly lit up| it becomes very romantic to walk around. There is also a lovely boutique selling beachwear and clothes.I booked a pedicure and massage at the spa. It was heaven! There is free wifi all round the hotel except in the restaurants. It is quite fast and I have had no problems with it. I really dont want to leave here!,Kent| United Kingdom,22-04-16,Yes,5
Honey Moon,Really nice resort.The room are clean and cosy.Tropical shower with a plus.Service was excellent| and food as well.A plus for le restaurant la caravel.Great spaGood choice for the sports activities.A little disapointed with the bar and their services as well as the products.Cocktails were not good and they don t propose fresh fruit juicesBut overall super hotel ,Pocatello| Idaho,22-04-16,Yes,4
Appalling customer service,I stayed here for a week on a business trip and unfortunately my baggage was lost by the airlines upon my arrival. I employed the hotel to help keep up with the status of my lost luggage and the concierge called the airlines a few times during the week but it was insufficient as no one was getting any answers. I spent the week communicating with the airlines on my own trying to locate my baggage and it was never found. I was given no other option than to purchase toiletries and new clothes from the gift store on site and when one of the dresses I purchased broke before I wore it| they refused to let me return it and I settled for an exchange. The worst part was when I was leaving| I had accrued over $600 in phone charges from calls made to the airlines in an effort to locate my bags because the staff was not offering any help. They refused to reverse the charges. I asked to speak with the manager multiple times and he/she never made the effort to speak with me directly. Completely unacceptable. Would not recommend this hotel because,Pocatello| Idaho,14-04-16,Yes,2
Beautiful facilities but lacking in some areas,Pros:Beautiful rooms| garden and spaGreat water sport facilitiesFantastic breakfastFriendly staffCons:Did not receive honeymoon additions such as sparkling wine| gift on arrival etcFood quality for lunch and dinner was not the greatest for the money spentNot many options for food out of the resort (we enjoyed Le Pescatore and Souvenir Restaurant)Most activities are in the south of Mauritius and it was expensive to travel there and required a 3 hour drive (return)Lots of kids and entertainment seemed geared towards them (I don't mind this but some might if they were on their honeymoon),Triolet,12-04-16,Yes,3
Wonderful,Trou aux Biches was an experience ! The hotel is a haven of comfort| elegance and friendliness. All staff from gardeners| cleaners| reception desk| to customer relations are of such a kindness and friendliness. Every request is immediately and efficiently answered to.Food at The Deck restaurant is great. At Oasis restaurant it is often the same or tastes the same. ,Belgium,11-04-16,Yes,5
Enjoyable - Amazing hotel and Great service,It is one of the best resorts in the island of Mauritius. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks goes to all the friendly and helpful staffs for providing an excellent service. The restaurants offer a wide variety of great food selection with international menus. Room was clean and tidy. Spa treatment was relaxing. Ease of accessibility to the different pools at each crescents of the hotel suites. We were very much satisfied with the checkout flexibility. From reservation| arrival to our departure| it was impeccable. I warmly recommend this hotel for a holiday stay.,Mauritius,11-04-16,Yes,5
Nice hotel let down by a few things,The Good: A renovated resort on a nice beach with beautiful swimming waters and all the watersports you could want. Nice buffet restaurant and good facilities in general including decent room wifi (Unlike most resorts they actually invested in the more expensive & superior Cisco technology). Staff are all very pleasant.The Bad: Its big and loses the far away feel when you're fighting for sun beds because of the numbers of people there. Everything not pre-paid for and all excursions are expensive. There's nothing in walking distance of the resort to go to for other eating options. Out of 6 restaurants| only 2 are any good.The Ugly: The staff whilst pleasant are not helpful when it comes to going outside of the resort - we had to force out of the concierge the fact that Grand Bay was worth visiting and only 10 mins in a taxi. The airport taxi the resort organised for us at a fixed rate was more expensive (when we got into it) than they told us and when I asked the hotel staff if they were going to help fix that| they said no. For that reason alone & in spite of most other things being good| I won't be going back there but I would recommend with caution.,London| United Kingdom,10-04-16,Yes,3

Trou Aux Biches ,What a place to stay in Mauritius| every detail is being taken care of| especially their manager Ms. Fatima and all staff is so friendly and individually looking after every guest. Breakfast and all meals are excellent. A must stay. Excellent sport activities at the hotel. ,Emirate of Abu Dhabi| United Arab Emirates,08-04-16,Yes,5
Not really a five star + hotel !,This hotel has no good price-quality evaluation. It's beautiful| with a beautifull beach| but service en food quality in the main restaurant is often poor. Maybe a nice place for people which not want to explore the things out of the hotel| but the contrast between the in and outside is disappointing.,Kortrijk| Belgium,07-04-16,Yes,3
A true paradise,"I'm normally lazy to write hotel reviews| but I feel compelled to do it this time!I have stayed at the hotel with my two teenage sons in March 2016| for two weeks. We have enjoyed the whole vacation there very much.Here are the highlights:Beach-+ Trou au Biches is one of the best beaches in Mauritius| with very fine white sand. I've been to the southeast before| where the sand beach was kind of yellowish. + It takes about 20 minutes to walk the whole beach from one end to the other. It's public beach (no private beach on the island| I've heard)| but very safe. It was really interesting to walk by all the friendly local people. + the beach is in a lagoon| so it's very safe to swim. We did snorkeling everyday| multiple times. The water is not too deep| so we were just slightly above the colorful corals| and there's so much fish swimming around us. Truly beautiful experience.+ Do rent a speed boat to go out a bit (5-10 minutes| not far) to swim with the dolphins. It was a fantastic! The dolphins there were really friendly. They seemed to enjoy entertaining us. Hotel-+ Service is simply great. I've stayed at many top beach resorts in Aisa| Europe and North/Central America. Without exaggeration| I find the hotel staff here the most friendly and genuine. All of them really make an effort to make guests feel at home. We felt very pampered.+ Food is very tasty and of high quality| (Le Deck| Blue Ginger Thai and Corallo Italian are the best). Don't miss the Italian restaurant: the menu is not big but all dishes we've had for the 4 dinners there are great; Maître Kevin is very friendly and efficient; chef Luca also comes to chat with guests| so don't miss the chance to ask for recipes!+Clarins Spa is definitely worth a visit. I tried the signature massage. It's one of the best I've ever had anywhere. +We had a beachfront suite with a small pool. It was only a few steps from the beach| very convenient and beautiful. Highly recommend!Some cons-- Breakfast buffet is a bit too crowded if you go there late. Sometimes you need to wait a bit to get a table. But then we ordered breakfast to the room a few times. A good alternative.- There were mosquitos there| and I've seen a cockroach in the room. But I guess there's nothing more the hotel can do against them. It is a part of the natural life there. This beautiful island will never be bug-free| but we could decide whether we should be ""bugged"" by it. Actually we even had a small lizard in our room. But you know what? This little creature eats mosquitos! My sons have developed a friendship with it during our two-week stay there.Highly recommend this hotel to anyone who loves warm ocean and values friendly service.",Munich| Germany,07-04-16,Yes,5
Amazing stay,We booked a villa with half-board pension. It was expensive but very very nice.The staff was excellent. There was always somebody to help| always in very good mood and everything seemed very easy.The food was very nice. The breakfasts were served in the villa (somebody stays there and organises things for you| sets the table| cleans up etc..) and hot local snacks were brought at around 6pm each day. Water and sodas were free from the minibar and there were plenty. Other minibar items were expensive but there was a shop at walking distance so we bought alcohol and snacks there. The restaurants were amazing... first| they look amazing| it was a fantastic experience to have dinner there| second the quality of the food was very nice... the Thai restaurant was great (it didn't feel 100% thai| maybe a bit more Chinese| but it was very nice nonetheless)| and the Indian restaurant was our favourite.. great atmosphere| delicious dishes.I would definitely suggest half-board or even full-board. Prices were expensive and the resort is so nice you don't really feel like dining outside. Being on half-board we didn't have to worry about this much... kids would eat in the miniclub during lunch (and food would be included at night) but the bill for drinks and all still was high at the end of the stay.The miniclub is great. It's full of activities and the kids loved it.The resort itself is extremely beautiful and very comfortable. We had spent two weeks prior to that on the East coast| with a rented car| visiting the island a lot| and when we got to Trou aux Biches| all we had left on our list was to relax... and the place was perfect for that :)Sea activities were included for free (I think for everybody... I might be wrong| I don't know.. for us it was free anyway) and that was brilliant as well. In particular I really enjoyed the snorkelling on the reef. It was amazing.Like in other resorts it was sometimes a bit hard to find a place to sit| on the beach or near the pool because people leave their towels there even though they're gone elsewhere. This wasn't an issue for us| in situations where it's clear the people aren't here| we just moved their stuff (usually just a towel or sometimes the Beachcomber magazine available in rooms/villas) and took the seats. It's a pity people act like that| there's definitely way more sitting available than needed... but the vast majority of them have a towel on them placed by somebody's who's not here right now :) Ah well| not a big thing... and that's the only negative thing I can think of :)The resort is big but there are golf cars going around. It's very easy to get a lift from the reception or to order one on the phone from the villa.The villa is fan-tas-tic. We've never stayed in a place like this before. I'm not even sure what to say about it... it's a U shape| around a pool| all surrounded by stone walls| outdoor bath| outdoor showers| sliding doors so all rooms can lead onto the central decking/pool... it's just amazing :)The Internet is 25mpbs both ways (DL and UL) with 4ms ping. You can http/https/ssl/ssh| I didn't encounter restrictions... the ISP seems to be behind a transparent proxy and some requests would get transparently blocked for an hour or two. Not a big deal though| probably some protections or false positives.The TV has channels for kids| sports (Canal+ and Canal+ sport in particular) and you play movies off USB sticks/HDD with the bluray player.The gym is nice| I ran and cycled over there.The gardens in the resort are amazing and there's a tree in particular| south of the villas in the East part of the resort where kids can swing from lianas (not sure if that's the right word)... the central pool area is great but there are also 4 or 5 other pools near villas and residences in the resort| so it's easy to find a nice spot if you want to be more quiet or away from other people a bit.The area near Grand Baie is a bit touristic but to be honest if you book a place like Trou Aux Biches| you don't need to travel much... this is a place to relax and to stay in| not an HQ to organize visits from.We split our stay in two| with a private villa near Trou d'Eau douce (called Stylia Villas| highly recommended as well) from where we visited the island| and here in Trou Aux Biches where we relaxed.This was amazingly relaxing| the week flew by and it finished our holidays in style :),London| United Kingdom,06-04-16,Yes,5
Amazing hotel| perfect for honeymoon,We stayed at Trou aux Biches for our honeymoon for 9 nights. The hotel is outstanding. The staff are so friendly and helpful| the complex is clean and never felt crowded. We had a beachfront villa with a plunge pool which was a stones throw from the beach. It felt private and we could watch the amazing sunsets from our patio. There is a gorgeous huge swimming pool which was virtually empty a lot of the time. We tried 4 of the restaurants and although a little pricey| the food was amazing| and the staff gave outstanding service. The free watersports were a bonus| unfortunately we couldn't get booked on the snorkelling trip so I would recommend booking early. We hired a car to see more of Mauritius as it's easy to drive around and we don't like organised trips. There's a local supermarket within walking distance which sells wine much cheaper than the mini-bar! Breakfast is great| so much choice it's difficult to choose! The beach is one of the best in Mauritius. Also felt really safe as there are security patrolling the beach and the entrance all the time. Would go back if we could afford it.,London| United Kingdom,05-04-16,Yes,5
Beautiful beach| great service - and bugs included,"During our honeymoon| we stayed 1 week at this hotel - not 10 days as origiinally planned. The hotel sports a beautiful beach and lushful scenery. The spa is awesome| and the evening entertainment every night at the bar is definitely worth visiting. Service is great| and among the restaurants we especially recommend the Mahiya (Indian) restaurant.That said| you should be willing to accept bugs. We did expect differently from a five star hotel| and the Beachcomber Dinarobin (of the same company) where we stayed the second week proved that you actually can have a great place without any animal issue. Thus| one should not accept simple statements such as ""we are on a tropical island| you know"" which we also had heard from the TAB staff. On day 2| we ran across one cockroach at the beach during daytime - which should be very unusual and should have warned us| if we had already known better. (Allegedly| the bugs only come out during the day when all the nests are too crowded so that the bugs have no other place to move). We laughed it off as coincidence| and this was out in the open anyway. On the same night| however| we had one cockroach crawling out of our toothbrush stand - which escaped (probably into the wooden flooring)| only to reappear and be killed by us one night later.We moved room| had one OK night| only to discover many mosquitos and another cockroach the day after. Chemical treatments by staff followed (my wife was pregnant and could not stand or stay for those)| which only drove the cockroaches out. Without being informed about the nature or effect of the treatments| we returned to the room to find 5 (!) cockroaches in the room. Again| we had to kill them ourselves. All in all| this ruined 3 days and nights of our honeymoon| which looking backward| we should have not accepted in the first place. We just did not feel comfortable in our room. Especially after a great day in the ressort| you do not want to look forward to a bug hunt or nighttime adventure in your room. Relaxing rest (or other honeymooner activity) was not possible.We admit that most staff members (save one frotndesk lady) have been extremely polite and responsive to our reports and complaints. They tried to be helpful and do their best. However| communication was not great - several times we had been promised that this was a one-time incident| and now everything should be fine. We cannot recall how many times we heard the words ""we will do a deep cleaning of the room"" .",Frankfurt| Germany,03-04-16,Yes,3
calm and romantic,I have to admit that this hotel is gorgeous!!!! It is so well designed|flowers every where trees and so quit.The beach is beautiful too.My room was huge well designed.I looved the outdoor shower.The food at the italian restaurant was yummy and the breakfast too.The quality of the hotel overall is on very high standards.,Thessaloniki| Greece,31-03-16,Yes,5
Piece of paradice for active honeymooners ,Spent a week there in June 2015. Had a tropical junior suite. Suites are spaceous| with big bathrooms. Although there are many of them| they are arranged in semi circles and are surrounded with wonderful gardens| which gives guests a lot of privacy an a feel of seclusion. Room service and cleaning are on a very high stanfard. Decorations could have more color rather than being smart beige and brown| but this is my personal taste.Food is absoludely awesome with a lot of variety served in buffet restaraunts during lunch and dinner. Food theme is changed often| so there is no chance for you to get bored of having same food. Think it was one of the best decisions someone took for me when management has upgraded us from half to full board (free). Specific kitchen restaurants (Indian| Thai- we tried only these) located on the premices are also very good.There are free water sports offered (learned how to water ski - staff was most helpful) - snorkeling| wind sports are also available. This option offers a good alternative to being lazy near a clear infinity pool or digging yoyr toes into a white sand on the beach. Will return if I have a chance. ,CH,30-03-16,Yes,5
Excellent hotel,Me and my daughter (grown up) stayed here for a week in March 2016. We couldn't have been more satisfied. The level of service is very high| the room we had was expensive but delivered value for money. It was spacious| clean| comfortable and the outdoor shower is amazing. The hotel area is beautiful and very well kept. The only little thing we could complain about is the very high price for coffee. A double espresso macchiato shouldn't cost 7 euros.We recommend to take a taxi to Grand Baie some evenings for dinner. The restaurants are excellent and not as expensive as the hotel restaurants.We will definitely come back next year!,Stockholm| Sweden,29-03-16,Yes,5
A Tale of Two Resorts,We spent the first half of our holiday at the Luxe Belle Mare Hotel and the Second Half at Trou Aux Biches Resort. The first resort was to a higher standard in all areas. It was still very informal and had many young children. The second resort was more value for money in terms of room space. However it was dated and the service was too laid back. The beach of the first resort had seaweed which gave the feel of stepping in mud near the shore. The second beach had sharp corals which pricked your feet. Swimming shoes can be bought at the local souvenir stores though. They both had a good Spa. At both resorts I missed the old world charm and elegance of Le Telfair which we visited nine years earlier. Asking Islanders the Royal Palm and the Prince Maurice are the most luxurious resorts on the island. I would have gone there if I knew this beforehand. ,Oxfordshire| UK.,28-03-16,Yes,3
Paradise in Mauritius,The private swimming pool was the high light| cristal clear water|the room was exceptionally big and modern furniture|as well as the bathroom|We loved the bath|indoor big shower and the outdoor shower?Oh what an amazing experience| our room face the sea|a few steps to the stunning beach| the gardens are very beautiful and well kept| the staff was very friendly specially the General Manager| she was a hands on|very busy and always with a big smile on her face!,Cape Town Central| South Africa,26-03-16,Yes,4
Fantastic,We enjoyed an excellent fortnight's at Trou aux Biches. We stayed in a villa type room with a private pool. (The pool was small| but more than adequate for our baby daughter to splash about in). The staff were| universally| extremely courteous. We arranged a trip via the hotel to Port Louis and Aapravasi Ghat (a UNESCO world heritage site)| which was well organised and executed in comfort (a BMW X5 provided transport). The beaches were great - clean and sandy| with temperate waters. The Bob Marlin kids club was enjoyable and well staffed| and scored extra points for its name. We treated ourselves to a hot stone massage at the spa| which otherwise provided a comprehensive range of treatments to a high standard. In terms of the hotel's clientele| they were mainly European| mostly French| but we met some folks from South Africa and the Gulf states too. The local area is safe. Overall| the food was excellent. Both the breakfast and lunch buffet options offered great variety and considerable quality. We opted for flexible dinner arrangements| so that we could dine out of an evening. We'd recommend this option| as there are several very good| cost efficient local establishments. That said| the dinner options on-site are all of merit too. We especially enjoyed the Indian meal which was exquisite. The Italian was more run-of-the-mill. Equally| the array of bar snacks could stand to be improved too. All small criticisms| which pale into relative insignificance. Dinner is followed each evening by live music. In all| highly recommended for families seeking a relaxing beach break.,London| United Kingdom,26-03-16,Yes,5
The treatment of the staff was always excellent| and we were especially well treated by the receptionist Ian.,The room was always cleaned and was especially wide and spacious| we felt really comfortable. We enjoyed most the activities offered by the resort; such as snorkeling and water-skiing which were truely amazing.,Barcelona| Cataluña| Spain,25-03-16,Yes,5
Very nice honeymoon. ,Stayed there for 15 nights in September. Perfect weather| excellent staff and wonderful rooms. The many restaurants gives you a high degree of satisfaction when dining in the hotel. Plenty of free activities| ranging from windsurfing to tennis. A lovely honeymoon for a young couple.The only drawback of the hotel is that they claim to have a private beach. This is absolutely not the case. It is impossible to relax with a swarm of locals trying to sell you all kinds of rubbish. And they are bloody persistent as well. But if you can ignore them the beach it self is absolutely marvellous! ,Jessheim| Norway,21-03-16,Yes,5
Excellence!!,We have been going to Trou Aux Biches twice a year for the past 16 years.The luxury| excellent service| friendly staff and perfect location is the selling point for us and we will keep going back.It has become our second home.,Sandton| South Africa,17-03-16,Yes,5
DREAM COME TRUE- HIGHLY RECOMMEND MOST ROMANTIC RESORT IN MAURITIUS,"My husband and I had the most beautiful Honeymoon at Trou Aux Biches! We received ""Royal"" treatment by all the staff|especially Chef Mario| Anwar| Jay| Devi| Ouma|Chef Ashley| Chef Shezad| Chef Danny | Jerome| Barlen| Chef Luca etc made this the most memorable vacation of all time! We can't thank them and Beachcomber Trou Aux Biches for such wonderful service rendered! The food was spectacular at L'Oasis| La Caravelle and IL' Corallo! Compliments to all the Chefs!! **Best Food Ever**.. We stayed at the Tropical Suite and it was the most Romantic and Superb stay! On several occasions we met with the Director Michael Daruty De Grandpre and Eam Villa Manager | Fatima |who made sure we receive an unforgettable honeymoon!!

a piece of luxury along a stunning beach,The territory is large and well arranged with villas placed in it. Rooms are quiet and spacious set in the middle of a green garden with privat pools where you can feel retreat. Rooms are a bit basic but autentic beachcomber dark wooden elegant style as usual who knows this hotel chain. Beach is gorgeaus| there is a stunning view for sunset over the huge pool right in front of the beach. Food delicious - here be sure you make a reservation in one of 3 restaurants opened for dinner. Location is excellent. Nearby you can find a small village| try local farrata for a little amount it´s a must! and buy some local rum|coffee etc in local supermarket for a very good price compared to turistic shops or airport. Hotel arrange some sport and evening activities every day to entertain guests. Fitness centre is huge and it worth when´s raining out. Wifi works great in the room and lobby. Not in bufe or on the beach for Nomads need to work. I´ve seen a lot that´s why i can not give 5 but this is definitely TOP hotel in Mauritius for resort-type holiday. The only thing i missed was a good coffe for coffe lovers as me.,Prague| Hlavni Mesto Praha| Czech Republic,15-03-16,No,4
Honeymoon!!,This is very good hotel| if you have a birhtday or your are going to marriage and looking honeymoon place. This Trou aux Biches is one of the best beach| food in hotel is excelent. If you don't want to do anything| this is good place. But if you don't want to only sleep| then here is also lot of program and this island is also good place to go to shopping.,Hyvinkaa| Finland,15-03-16,No,5

Top quality hotel,We spent 7 nights in this hotel and I must admit this is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in during our many trips in various countries around the world! Classy hotel| excellent service| very impressed with staff and the SPA is a gem! It does not come cheap but it is well worth it!,The Hague| The Netherlands,13-03-16,Yes,5
Paradise,We booked a room with a pool- if you are going to an island and the beach is a purpose then a room with a pool on the beach is a must. I am not sure why only few resorts on the island offer this. Was a great stay and higly recommended.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,09-03-16,Yes,5
Very good overall experience,Just have an eye on cleanliness of room. Besides that it is an excellent location with excellent restaurants and a great variety of meals.Water sports provided are also a big plus. In general to Mauritius: There's not that much to discover on the islandand it's not very charming| including Port Louis| as the capitol.,Hamburg| Germany,09-03-16,Yes,4
Great place| poor service,Mauritius is a stunning beautiful island! Hotel did a good job with the beach: it is long| sun beds are high quality| enough umbrellas| nice towels. Great watersports. Hotel architecture is basic but I understand that the purpose is to make the buildings merge with the nature| and appreciate the approach. Hotel is very clean. Food is great. Now the flip side. Service is amazingly bad for 5 star hotel: people are extremely helpful but in most cases are useless to serve you. Half of the staff are trainees! You do not come to 5 star hotel to educate trainees! The territory is large and well kept but in my opinion could be better decorated with flower plants. Paths are not well lit so you need a torch to go to dinner. There are no changing rooms in the beach| and only a couple toilets on a 1 km long beach. No taps to rinse feet at the beach. I must say| all in all we managed to enjoy our vacation| so good luck to you! :-),Limerick| Ireland,08-03-16,Yes,3
Wonderful place!,We stayed for nine nights in a three bedroom villa at Trou Aux Biches Resort. 4 adults & three kids aged 10-13. It was an amazing stay! The villa was really nice with a lot of space & privacy. It was great to have our own pool| we enjoyed it a lot. Also nice with the sofa and the dining area outside| we spent most of our evenings dining there. Great to have the opportunity to cook!Our private butler took great care of us and made sure that we had water| coffee| sodas| fresh towels or anything we needed. Breakfasts at the Caravelle restaurant were great| as well as dinner at the Italian restaurant. All the crew at the resort were very professional| friendly and service minded. The manager welcomed us at arrival| made sure we enjoyed our stay and she was even there to say goodbye upon departure. Impressive! We enjoyed the snorkeling trips| the water skiing| canoeing| sailing & took a dolphin tour one morning with the crew at the boat house. Amazing! The spa was nice| kids enjoyed the pool table and the table tennis and we played some tennis as well. I went running in the mornings| both on the roads and on the beaches. Mont Choisy Public Beach has a nice trail - much recommended!The resort is big| but nevertheless felt calm & quiet| not crowded att all| even though it was fully booked when we arrived there. We definitely recommend Trou aux Biches Resort and would really like to go back one day :)!,London| England| United Kingdom,08-03-16,Yes,5
The best beach in the North,Outstanding villa with outdoor pool| safe and tropical environment| great service and provisions| all staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. Room for improvement for WiFi range and quality. Very well organized beach| staff to be commended for cleaning and swiping the beach daily| there should be a fine for those who leave cigarette butts and plastic behind.,London| England| United Kingdom,07-03-16,Yes,4
Fantastic child-friendly 10 year wedding anniversary,As we had our dream beach wedding here 10 years ago| this was the perfect destination to bring our 9 year old! The staff went to great lengths to make it an incredibly special time| including inviting out little one to the kids club. Despite the time of year| the weather was still warmer than the UK| allowing us to swim outdoors every day| and the hotel upgrades made it a very special experience. Despite offering a number of specialist cuisines| we tended to stick with the a la carte restaurant for most meals. This time| we went on an island tour| highly recommended| where we got a feel for the rest of the beautiful destination. The changes to the rooms were welcome| too| so lovely and spacious - but we didn't try the outdoor shower because the evenings were a little cooler to be comfortable. Taking advantage of the free watersports| we managed to balance activity with relaxation well. We honestly got back planning our next trip - and will definitely be looking to upgrade our flight (time of year meant a large number of crying children| so I got very little sleep both ways!).,Paris| France,06-03-16,Yes,5
Excellent hotel and restaurants,We stayed for 8 nights in a family room (Villa). This is perfect for a family with two kids! The villa seem to be newly renovatade. The AC works very well in this hot and humid climate. The housekeeping staff have kept the room in perfect condition the entire stay. All the restaurants are of the highest quality. We must acknowledge the excellent staff at Trou aux Biche and specifically Chef Ehsan and Mr Mohan of the restaurant Le Deck. Chef was very nice to us throughout the entire stay and made special menus. You must visit the hotel restaurant on friday nights when they organize the lobster bbq on the beach. It is truly an experience! We want to acknowledge Jay and San who both made sure the service flowed perfectly.The breakfast buffet is well organized and always clean. I'm very picky about eating from buffets but in this case I only have great comments.We will be coming back!,Paris| France,04-03-16,Yes,5
Wonderful Stay!,We had a truly fantastic holiday. We travelled with two kids (aged 4 and 2) and stayed in the standard suite. Room was amazing. we loved the outdoor shower and it was very spacious and perfect for our little family of four. We did demi-pension and would recommend doing at least demi-pension if not all three meals. Food is good but expensive if you are not on a meal plan. We loved spending our days by the main pool and i have to specifically thank Rajesh| Vinay and Nitesh who were amazing and truly made our holiday extra special with the attention and care they provided us and the kids. We also enjoyed the mini club and are very grateful to jonathan and all the wonderful staff there. We would definitiely return again.,Paris| France,04-03-16,Yes,5
Wonderful hotel| great for dining| water sports and doing nothing,The design and facilities of the hotel are just great. Service is also excellent. A lot of complimentary water sports activities| more than usual. 6 different restaurants to choose from. We stayed in the senior beachfront suite with pool which was a bit expensive| but i believe that the junior suites offer great value for money. Really nothing to complain about with perhaps the exception that our private pool was hardly private as it is 3 feet away from the path along the beach.20% of the guests were dog eating island thieves.,Doha| Qatar,04-03-16,Yes,5
Amazing ,If words could describe this hotel the only word would be Paradise ... Outstanding service | amazing food | beautiful surroundings and the rooms are just out of this world. . :) This is a must experience it is well worth the price especially on a AI. Could not fault a thing... ***** ,Cape Town| South Africa,02-03-16,Yes,5
Main pool,Excellent setting with a child friendly pool.The service at the pool was very pleasant. Nitish the server who took care of us was friendly and very professional satisfying every need we had. We were traveling with our 15 month old son and had a great time!,Los Angeles| California,01-03-16,Yes,5
Beautiful hotel| mediocre food and way overpriced.,This is a beautiful resort| the landscaping is incredibly beautiful| the service is very pleasant even if not extremely professional.The family suit is perfect for parents and kids. Chose ground floor its the best. The beach is nice| not very large but comfortable. There are 4 swimming pools since it's a huge complex so you don't have to walk all the way to the big swimming pool every time. Very nice kids club.The one big disappointment is the food. It's simply not good and extremely overpriced!! The restaurants ( Thai| Indian ) are just OK but they cost 250€ every night out. The wine is awful. The service is slow| ( at least 2 hours ). No air conditioning so dress with a light shirt | long pants are a must for the guys. The breakfast and dinner buffet is mediocre. There are groups playing at night but only till 11pm. After that it's pretty much dead. Kind of a mixed feeling about this place. I liked it but would like to try something else next time to see what else Maurice has to offer.,Los Angeles| California,29-02-16,Yes,4
Wonderfully restful holiday ,We normally frequent club med but they could Mach our dates so we decided to stay here. We had a wonderful time| hotel and gardens are beautiful kept and the beach. We didn't want for anything. The buffet food was good but not great| the restaurants were good but for South Africans a bit expensive. Overall a wonderful time and we will be back,Cape Town Central| South Africa,26-02-16,Yes,5
Mix feelings,The suites are excellent and the comfort level is at the level of 5 stars. However their restaurants' service and food is quite a debatable issue. Food can be bland and tasteless or too salty. Services are really not a 5* level. Waiters are never around to clear used plates and no attendance to guest. Live music| they could hire more professional singers. would rather have a nice light back ground music while having dinner than a singer pushing the pitch to make your hair straighten up.,Montreal| Canada,24-02-16,Yes,3
7 nights + 8 days Family Holiday,Every year we go on a family holiday| we're used to Dubai and Abu Dhabi and NYC. So Mauritius was a little different for us this year| we had a great time and after a couple of days got to know the staff and hotel very well. The advantages are:+Rooms had a great view| overlooking a swimming pool| and had an outside shower+Great service by staff on the beach (Sanjay)+Very child friendly| very popular with the children.+Tai restaurant excellent service (it was my parents wedding anniversary| and although it was a couple days late| they brought out a cake saying happy wedding anniversary on it and deducted £10 from our meal)+Grounds are kept in imaculuate condition+Italian restarant was our favourite| service was Nadish was great as was the food (on the first time we went| not so great for my dad on the last night we went)+Beach was open to the public| making it have a lovely atmosphere| and getting to know the men on the beach selling things to you| as well as the roaming dogs exploring on the beach.+Always entertainment (singers to jazz players to Indian dancing)+x5 pools very peaceful and calming (beds go very fast!) +Restaurant reservation always managed to book us in| even though they do full up fast and advise you book at once for the week.However the disadvantages:-No wifi on the beach or restaurants- Mixed service and can be rather dirty (one man spoke to my mothers chest throughout the entire conversation)-Bathroom flush didnt work properly and resulted in a leak from the toilet| making the bathroom smell. My parents light switch for them also sparked every time you pressed it.-Buggy service needed to be improved| for the week we stayed there we caught our buggy 3 times to our room as it was further away| this was because nobody stopped or asked if we would like a ride and went rather fast resulting in one of the drivers knocking into a woman during her stay.-Food and drinks are limited to 1 at lunch and 1 at dinner| with all inclusive. For a G&T it cost nearly £10 per one!-No body lotion with the shampoo and conditioner-Was bitten alive down by the pool and with mosquitos at night (hotel cant help that though)-At breakfast birds were pecking and eating the food at the buffet.-Very dark outside your room and in toilets| not very well lit throughout the hotelOverall it was an extremely relaxing holiday| and would definitely return!,Cardiff| United Kingdom,22-02-16,Yes,4
Great hotel and good snorkeling,"We stayed for three nights in a room (322-325)| quite close to the restaurants and sports center| but a bit from the beach. We loved our room on the second floor| nice view of the pool and short walk to everything. Make sure that you book restaurants for the whole stay the same day you arrive| preferably at once. The pool is very nice| but we found the beach a bit disappointing. We had dinner in Blue Ginger| La Caravelle and Il Corallo and liked the food in all the places| breakfast is also very good. Lunch is not included and is quite expensive| so we chose to walk to the ""center"" (down the beach) and bought sandwiches from one of the stalls among the trees - cheap and very good. We went on their snorkeling trip every day- very good| but would be nice if they stopped at different places. We had a late flight and were able to keep the room until we left - great service.",Norway,19-02-16,Yes,5
Wonderful staff.,Great location| nice beach. Very clean surroundings. Food at open buffet was much better than A la Carte restaurants.Any misgivings are easily forgotten thanks to the phenomenally polite and friendly employees.Congratulations to the management.,Istanbul| Turkey,18-02-16,Yes,4
Tropical Island Paradise,Spent a week at this amazing property. Were blown away by the sheer size of the resort when we entered. Check in was a breeze and the staff at the reception were very courteous even though they were under immense pressure of many guests trying to check-in at the same time.Food- Being vegetarians we initially thought it might be a bit difficult for us. But we were proved wrong. The servers and guys in the kitchen did their best to make sure we didn't have any problem whatsoever. Special meals were made for us and they would prepare what we wished to eat as long as we told them a day before.Were booked on the full board meal plan. This means that we could eat at any of the restaurants of the hotel. Mahiya| Blue ginger and Oasis (buffet) were our favorite. You just need to ensure you need to book a day prior in order to get a table at the specialty restaurants. Was a fabulous dining experience throughout with great service| quality| variety and taste.Rooms-We had the beach front Pool Suite Room.It was a large room and had the best possible view.Well maintained and well equipped with a comfortable bed and powerful air conditioner. Outdoor shower was fun to use. Good quality interiors with french fittings. Wi-fi in the room was strong and fast.Activities-You really would not want to do anything else since you have a spectacular stretch of beach that lines the resort.Well maintained and kept really clean in immaculate condition. Activities at beach house are great and so is the staff there. You need to book your activities in advance though to avoid disappointment.There is an active kids club and various other activities for adults at the gigantic main pool throughout the day.Its quite happening.Me and my wife were really happy to have stayed there since it was truly paradise. And the best part would be that though the resort is really enormous it definitely does have a soul. The staff would acknowledge your presence and would go length and breath to address literally anything. Special thanks to Sous Chef Maudi| Jay at Oasis and Fatima for making our trip even better. Would definitely return one day.,Mumbai| India,17-02-16,Yes,5
Favorite property in Mauritius thus far!,Due to a boohoo at another property| we made a last minute booking for Trou aux Biches the night before our check-in date. As it was a weekend| the front desk had trouble locating our last minute booking from their system and the check-in process took longer than usual. Belinda at the front desk was happy to help me locate four rooms| upgrading us to a higher room tier from the Junior Suites that we have booked. No easy feat for such a busy property! The rooms were beautiful and spacious| and had all the bells and whistles we need for a beach vacation. Lunch at Le Deck was delicious (try the Coconut Salad and Chicken Wrap| yum!). We had a late evening flight to catch and the hotel was happy to extend a late checkout for one of our rooms till 6pm| while the rest of the group made use of the transit rooms to wash up before our flights. This was totally a great value add service that I love to see more at luxury hotels!Excellent property and a big thank you to Belinda at the front desk!,Singapore| Singapore,16-02-16,Yes,5
Very nice and cool hotel ,I really enjoyed the time at this hotel. It's super close to the beach and the food is delicious. You can also do a lot of water sports for free and everything is close. We also did a dive course and it was great. In case you consider that| ask for Rajesh. He's a great dive master. Even though we had 2 days of rain| but we enjoyed also that time and I just highly can recommend this hotel| Spa| tennis courts & food ,Singapore| Singapore,14-02-16,Yes,5
Dream Destination Wedding accommodation,The hotel was chosen by the bride and groom and we were a party of 50 from Asia| Australia and S Africa. Rooms are comfortable. Several restaurants to choose from although there are more economical options nearby. The NW is probably a logical choice as port Louis is close by to Trou aux Biches. Concierge service was outstanding. Kudos to Sarah| who personally guided us on tour options. The beach itself was nothing to write home about. The gardens of this resort are immaculately maintained. Compare pricing for comparable 5 star hotels if you are planning a week in mauritius,Singapore| Singapore,12-02-16,Yes,4
Week in true Paradise,We stayed for a week. It was very good experience. Extremely friendly staff starting from front desk till restaurants and beach personnel. Rooms were very clean and cosy. Food in all restaurants was also very good.,Tallinn| Estonia,11-02-16,Yes,5
Best hotel ,We have all enjoyed our stay at this 5* hotel. Good service and very professional staff. The room is just perfect with its outdoor bathroom and really enjoy it and the room is very spacious. Unfortunately we got an indian buffet with not a large variety of food and did not really meet our expectation.,Munich| Germany,11-02-16,Yes,4
Not a five star - service mixed - tomb like suites - dark,Recommended by friends we had high hopes. Unfortunately| this resort does not live up to the standars of a five star resort. The service was excelkent in some areas (maids| evening restaurants) but below average during breakfast| the reception desk was a desaster (slow| unfriendly and inefficient) and there was no real beach butler. They are extremly stingy with beachtowels and expect you to lie on the towel which you also have to use to dry yourself after swimming. The manager| Fatima| is very nice in saying hello but this is as far as it goes. She did not even bother to ask why we shortened our stay and left two days earlier than planned. We had a suite with sea view and private pool. The pool and the view were true to description but the room was dark like a tomb. Insufficient light and dark wood would make you want to escape this room whenever possible. We recommend trying one of the other Beachcomber Hotels on Mauritius.,Munich| Germany,11-02-16,Yes,3
The most Luxurious Haven!,Firstly |the welcome.the rooms!the service!the outdoor shower.exquisite property.soft white sand.prompt beach service |Rambo my favourite.but most of all Fatima's hands on approach to guest and staff satisfaction is truly remarkable!I recommend this property to anyone that has a need for superb cuisine prepared to perfection|attention to detail in your room|and bathroom.wonderful shows|and warm feel.its like your home away from home.,George| South Africa,08-02-16,Yes,5
Family holiday January - February 2016,From start to finish we had a fabulous time. The staff were faultless and would go out of there way to help. The facilities were excellent and varied. We had a great time with water sports and they catered for our level| very professionally. The spa| gym and tennis courts were equally of a high standard.We took the villa option and found the privacy was just to our taste. A wonderfully comforting feel to our relaxed beach holiday. The villa itself was tastefully decorated| with a very modern feel and maintained twice a day| by the assigned maid / butler. The private pool simply added to our great experience.The local area has a well stocked supermarket and a local bus stop. It meant we had choice| which we took advantage of| to keep to our budget.All in all| a great holiday| that felt a little like a dream and one that we plan to return to| in the not too distant future!,Triolet,05-02-16,Yes,5
Absolute perfection!,We stayed here on our honeymoon and had an amazing time. Staff were very welcoming| informative and helpful. Service and food in the restaurants was impeccable. Definately a relaxing resort for honeymoon and would love to go again!,London| United Kingdom,05-02-16,Yes,5
Stayed in two bedroomed villa from 16th Jan to 21st Jan 2016.,This is a spectacular hotel specially for all couples and families with lots of privacy.The service from the staffs is excellent. In the villa you can have fresh breakfast cookedright in your kitchen and we had our butler named Radha who cooked for us and managed the villa. What a wonderful woman she is.She made us feel at home such that we were very reluctant to go back home.We definitely going back.I would say keep it up to the management!,Mombasa| Kenya,30-01-16,Yes,5
a great place,The resort is located at a gorgeous beach. rooms are nice and spacious| the service is very friendly. Lots of honeymooners and families with kids! During our stay in Mauritius we spend half of the nights there and the rest in Lux Belle Mare| if I compare I must say we enjoyed Lux Belle Mare more.,Barcelona| Spain,22-01-16,Yes,5
"Beautiful| but very expensive and definitely not ""full board'",Family stay for a week| lovely rooms with outside shower although the decor is clinical with no colour or special unique touches. We opted for full board plus which is a myth - a very expensive option that definitely does not include enough. Limited alcohol| limited choices| forced to have the same at each restaurant unless you pay the very expensive surcharges on the menu items you really want (lamb| calamari| steak). Irritating to say the least to have things like water| wine and beer limited to one glass per meal per guest. Lovely pool area| good restaurants although not outstanding. Staff are very attentive and professional.,Salt Rock| KZN,16-01-16,Yes,4
Christmas Stay,"We had a wonderful suite - overlooking the beautiful beach and pier. Spacious and comfortable although a bit of an ""industrial"" feel to the decor - predominantly grey. A real wow was the outdoor shower. Fabulous! However| we had problems with noise being too close to the night entertainment. Make sure you are at least 100m from the swimming pool area for a certain quiet night.The guests are mainly French and having hoped for some form of a Christmas lunch we were disappointed and in fact| for us| Christmas was disappointing. The only restaurant serving any semblance of a festive meal was the buffet - and it was truly awful.I expect the French guests ate a celebration meal on Christmas Eve but we were totally unaware of any event and the Christmas Day Lobster and Champagne supper on the beach was a surprise until the marquee went up and by this time already booked up.One quirk of the hotel is that a lovely manager| with over 25 years service the hotel works the crowd everyday at least once. Delighted the couple of times - but tiresome all teh time and by the end we were almost jumping i the bushes. However any issue we had was worked on and quickly and efficiently and it does seem rather churlish to knock this - but it was more than necessary. As half board guests we thought we would be able to swap lunches and dinners but this was not the case - and therefore we ate at the hotel in the evenings. The Thai and Italian being especially good. But we would have preferred to have eaten locally at least a couple of times in the evening and sussed out a few places on the way to Grand Baie. This is a quaint town worth a visit. Absolutely stunning beach front - Flipper might have visited here!Factory shops in our experience were a bad experience! Cashmere is sold by the gram! Not the climate for trying on cashmere and the taxi drivers and shop staff are pushy. Beach hawkers were also insistent and in the end we took to the verandah of the suite to escape the ceaseless interruption.Am I moaning? well yes - but on balance the hotel| beach and staff were superb and a wonderful| relaxing time complete with plenty of tennis gave us a holiday to remember. A well appointed hotel| spotless and attentive - to be recommended.",London| United Kingdom,14-01-16,Yes,4
5 stare location v 2/3 stars service ,Let's start with the only real positive: the hotel has an excellent position with a beach that for Mauritius standard is very beautiful.For the rest the experience is mostly disappointing due to one of the worst level of service I have experienced in the last -0 years in a 5 stars hotel.Whilst we and two interconnecting rooms 15 away from the beach| the structure and layout of the rooms (the bathroom is nice and spacey) are amongst the worst ever with such limited natural light that one has to turn on the lights even at midday with blinding sun outside.The reception has a polite manager but the rest of the staff is rude| unfriendly and mostly far from the level of professionalism required for such as establishment. But this is quite in line with the general level of service: from the activities on the beach to the restaurant reservation to the room service| one never gets what one wants in a reasonable amount of time. Overall the is a clear signs of a very absent management in the best of views.The food is average and far worse than the 3 other hotels we have visited in Mauritius. The best option is the Italian restaurant for dinner.One thing that surprised me was that in the all inclusive or half board (which we picked) no drinks are included| not even water which costs ridiculous amounts.The hotel is a better option for family with children as the beach| pools and tennis courts provide plenty of choices for the kids but I would never recommend it to couples as there is no option for any form of privacy for anyone in the whole resort (again like for the rooms| very poor layout when planned).The spa is nice (service mentality still absent) and the treatment are at a competitive price.Overall I would and considering the price and the alternatives on the island I would never recommend it. We ended up here because we booked the Nee Year week very late and this was pretty much the only hotel with availability.,Zurich| Switzerland,13-01-16,Yes,3
Beautiful place| excellent facilities,Stayed in a 3-bedroom villa over New Year. Villa was very spacious| everything to a high standard. Lovely private pool on a walled garden / decking area giving total privacy. We had a housekeeper (Sharmila) who was excellent| made us breakfast every day and kept the villa very clean and tidy. The hotel gardens and landscaping is amazing| the beach is beautiful. The choice of restaurants is very good and quality of food is excellent. My only request for improvement would be the speed of service in the bars (esp. Oasis)| which at times was very slow. Perhaps this is Mauritian style and perhaps I should have slowed down a bit| but holiday time is precious and I don't want to be waiting 20 minutes for drinks| then another 20 minutes for the bill! Don't let that put you off this place| it is really excellent and we had a fantastic holiday.Thanks to all the staff| especially those serving the villa guests. Sarah on the Concierge desk also worth mentioning| she was very helpful.,Guildford| United Kingdom,09-01-16,Yes,5
LOVELY PLACE,The best hotel we could during our trips to visit beautiful| tropical garden| a beautiful and clean beach with beach service| comfortable seats| clean and warm sea| peaceful and relaxing place for all ages. We can only recommend| go here it's heaven on earth.Thank,Pongola| South Africa,07-01-16,Yes,5
Great location| average food and terrible service...,"Great location| the hotel has been rebuilt 5 years ago. It is extremely relaxing| very ""zen""| but we found it lacked a bit of charm in its construction. Gardens are luxurious. The beach is long (although not wide)| and a variety of water sports are available. Our room was a family suite which was definitely cold and impersonal. Bed was way too hard| and pillows were good for reading but not for sleeping. Food was average| and service absolutely terrible - not to say debilitating - in most of the restaurants. No sauna is available for guests (you have to book a Spa treatment)| only hammam next to the gym. The latter is extremely well furbished both in quantity and quality. 6 tennis courts and 2 ping pong tables of the same vein. However| we found the shortcomings unexpected for a 5-star hotel. We also asked for a room close to the sea as we booked directly with the hotel| and ended up having a suite that was the farthest away from the beach!",Pongola| South Africa,05-01-16,Yes,4
Would return in a heartbeat with my husband!!!,I did extensive research on ALL the 5 star resorts in Mauritius. My top picks I just really did not want to spend THAT much on a hotel room. So after reading the reviews of ALL of the resorts| I decided on this one being my choice. I chose this 1 because of the bad reviews| the things didn't seem THAT bad and I liked the idea of 6 restaurants.This trip was just me and my husband and I wanted to romantic| luxury| good service| all of the above! I was nervous because I really didn't want to go to a hotel and regret choosing it because that can make or break a holiday!NO doubt| we chose the right hotel/resort! I AM the pickiest and most critical person about all businesses I ideal with. Being an American and used to good service and prompt replies and competent personal| I am VERY hesitant to give a good review on anything! I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat! This hotel is apparently the largest on the island (that had me skeptical that it would not be very good). However| this hotel was booked solid while we were there and you would have never known it! The grounds are so spread out that everyone has their own space (sort of feel). Because the resort is so huge| you have to call for a golf cart at the front desk to come pick you up to take you to reception if that is where you are wanting to go. Everytime we called for a golf cart| by the time we stepped out of the door the golf cart was there or at least making the corner to come get us. The staff did everything they could to help us in any way. We also liked this resort because of its close proximity to Grand Baie. We wanted to be able to get out of the resort and do other things. And we did every day! This resort has 22 taxis that are available daily to take you wherever you want to go! We used the boathouse 1 time to go snorkelling and it was SO much fun!!!! The crew at the boathouse was so friendly and efficient! The guys running the boats to take people water skiing probably asked us 3 times while we were waiting on the snorkel boat if we wanted to go waterskiing. They just want to please and want you to have fun! This is when we decided we are returning but bringing our 6 year old daughter next time! The ONLY thing I didn't like about the resort was the fact that men have to wear trousers to dinner| no matter how hot it is outside! This had us going in to Grand Baie just about every night for dinner| but truly we didn't mind because we liked the idea to get out of the resort.The restaurants I can not comment on except the buffet. We did eat the buffet the first night we were there. It was fine. It is a typical HUGE hotel type buffet. Nothing more than that! I have been to nice buffets where I can chose my own fish and they will grill it| this was not that. But it would have something for any picky eater| etc. The bars were good. The only 1 I enjoyed was La Carvelle bar because they did make a good Strawberry daiquiris. I probably researched for this trip longer than I even spent on the trip. We were there for 4 days and I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat! It can be great for just husband and wife or families! We stayed in a Tropical Suite with the outside shower! I liked it a lot. Glad I didn't do the junior suite because I think those were up stairs (above the Tropical rooms). The rooms with ocean view and pools looked very nice but I was not disappointed to not be in 1 due to the view is not too great of the ocean (lots of trees| etc). Highly recommend this hotel for couples or families!,Pongola| South Africa,04-01-16,Yes,5
Great stay on a magic place,In this hotel at trou aux biches| we were able to combine a stay in a luxurious hotel and being very near to a real local village by a magnificent beach| likely the most beautiful one on this island. The main hotel swimming pool is impressive. I guess the food although being very good could be improved,Paris| France,02-01-16,Yes,5
Lovely location ,When you return to a resort a person has very high expectations| this was our 3rd trip and 2nd since the refurbish. It was just my husband and myself. Sadly in the year and a half that we were last here I have seen a huge change. I would go as far as saying it has lost a star grading. This is not the 5 star I know. Firstly positive |the position on the island|the sea is wonderful no need for sea shoes| weather on this side is better. The gardens are spectacular. The room| we had a junior suite with outside shower. Nice room but the air cons are leaking causing a lot of damp and damage. The inside shower the same damp spots. The bath had no pressure at all so just showered. The wooden floor boards are lifting by shower. Room is fine. As a few people mentioned no milk only milk powder!! We booked breakfast and dinner. If a person is not up and ready the restaurant closes at 10. So many mornings are a rush|no chance to sleep in. Breakfast very average. The island has so much lovely fresh fruit why not let people make their own fresh juice. The juice was huge bottles and not fresh. No gluten free crackers or cereals at all. In fact no diet food what so ever. Never saw skim or fat free milk. Also coffee was beyond shocking. Had to order bar coffee. Dinner we ate at the main restaurant buffet style. Very average| and to be honest no meal was a wow for me. Lots of pork| sea food which I don't eat. So many nights were not easy to find anything. We ate at the finer dining twice where you can choose what you want| much nicer but must book before. The bar is very expensive. Don't get me wrong it is a lovely resort but this time of the year| Xmas to New Year is way overpriced| and especially for South Africans. Felt it was not value for money. The staff are friendly especially Fatima| the resort manager. Word of caution the beach vendors are a pest and found them to be very rude!! Will recommend the resort but take a full package and be prepared to pay for anything extra. Very fortunate to celebrate my birthday in Mauritius ,South Africa,02-01-16,Yes,4
Stunning Room,We stayed at this resort for 11 days and had a senior suite and a executive suite. Stunning rooms with lovely pools. Resort very dark at night so felt very vulnerable. Had a security problem that was dealt with but left us feeling insecure especially my daughter. Choose a room that is closer to the main reception for extra security as there is a public beach area at the end of the resort. beach very narrow so no privacy when lying on loungers. As all beaches are public no peace and quiet so thank goodness for the rooms with private pools and sundeck. Food becomes a bit of a bore after 5 days and choosing other restaurants with all the supplements for this and that becomes very confusing and VERY expensive. We chose a package that included breakfast and supper but you still have to pay for all and I mean ALL your drinks including a coffee and water and it is pricey so beware ! Cocktails/alcoholic beverages are just way too expensive so unfortunately the bar areas were always quiet...who can spend a whooping 450 rupees (180rand) for a basic cocktail ! Resorts should introduce a happy hour or at least a free cocktail or something. Bars were always empty so no vibe in the entertainment areas.,Knysna| Western Cape| South Africa,27-12-15,Yes,3
Amazing stay with family (2 year + 4 Year old),About an hour drive from the airport. We had originally booked the Tropical Junior Suite but were upgraded on arrival to the Family Suite. This room was fantastic| with 2 big spacious bedrooms and 2 separate bathrooms with an outdoor shower and also a patio area outside to lounge on. Both the showers were strong power showers| there is also a large bathtub which we did not use. The grounds of the hotel are quite vast so the best way of travelling to different areas was to use the Club Car which would pick you up from outside the room and take you to any part of the hotel! We never really needed to use the pram as most parts of the hotel were within walking distance. The Gym is equipped with brand new machines| although only a small selection of dumbells (no barbell or rack). There is watersports available (free) at the hotel which has to be booked in advance. There are also 2-3 companies operating on the beach with whom you can do other watersports/dolphin watch (worth the price!)The breakfast spread was fantastic| everything you could wish for. The restaurants were even better (except for the indian which did very bland food). The beef burger is an absolute must try| please please do not leave without having tried this burger. It is quite simply to die for. We had free fast Wifi in the room enough to watch Youtube videos with ease. Towels were replaced twice a day The snorkeling (around 5 min free boat ride from beach) was not as good as it is in Sharm el sheikh for example. I was quite disappointed with the marine life to be fair. If there were any negative points| i would say the club car can take a little while (15--20mins) during meal times| maybe families should get priority?Also the Indian restaurant was a big disappointment as the food was not spicy how indian food should be. ,Blackburn| United Kingdom,26-12-15,Yes,5
Holiday at Trou Aux Biches,This hotel absolutely fantastic the food was great great variety of restaurants around the hotel friendly staff spacious rooms |for children plenty of activities for adults relaxing one down side the beach would I go there again absolutely ,Johannesburg| South Africa,26-12-15,Yes,5
Privileged location,The hotel has a very nice and well maintained landscape in a prime location on one of the most beautiful beach of Mauritius. The beachfront villas are well oriented and of a good size. The lunch at La Caravelle| an open space restaurant with a stunning view| was very good however service was a little bit slow. Overall we had a very good time.,Cape Town| South Africa,25-12-15,No,4
Excellent hotel and location for our Honeymoon part deux but guest relations could be better!,After staying 7 nights at the all-inclusive Beachcomber hotel| Le Canonier (also reviewed)| we wanted to wind down in a 5 star hotel for the remaining 3 nights of our stay (and to dry out). TaB hotel didn't disappoint in quality or facilities - really stunning location and a very grand hotel| grounds| pools and restaurants. We were greeted with drinks and cool towels while we checked in| but then things started to go wrong. The front desk girl asked us for our marriage certificate but no one had told us to bring it with us and it was locked in a drawer at home! We were only there 3 nights so we didn't want to spend a chunk of that time trying to get them a copy from the UK! The girl didn't seem to understand that concept and we tried to show her our wedding photos instead. This didn't wash with her and she told us what we could have got if we had have provided the certificate! Yeah| great| thanks… This wasn't providing the once in a life time experience we were hoping for... We asked to use the desk phone to call our excellent travel agent but she said no| but we could use our room phone instead at our cost - yes| very helpful!!! Feeling miffed we went to our fabulous room - the smallest they do but still amazingly well appointed. I contacted our travel agent and they couldn't do enough for us and said that the situation would be sorted immediately. I believe something was done by Beachcomber but the hotel somehow messed this up. We returned to reception for dinner to check that it had all been resolved but the different desk staff just said that our dinner booking was all OK - yes| we know that and we only told you that because Fatima (the manager) was supposed to meet us there according to our message. What we wanted to know was that we had the honeymoon package that we were supposed to have! The girl then understood and said it would be all OK from now on. We informed our travel agent that it was now OK.The next day we went to the Spa to book our free couples massage but the Spa said we weren't entitled as we weren't registered as a honeymoon couple - argh! We said that we were and they should talk to Fatima! She called her and we were booked in. Phew!We went to lunch where we were supposed to now be full board - at the end of the meal we were presented with a meal bill - argh! You are not registered for full board| he said. Oh no| is it going to be like this everywhere| we wondered. He said don’t worry| it will be removed from your bill at check out – erm| excuse us if we don’t feel reassured by this statement.Back in the room we found a voucher for some free gifts – great! Off to the hotel shop we go. The girl said we can have a T shirt but not in my size! Argh! You can also have an identical sarong that you got in the last hotel – ‘erm| how about a different colour this time|’ we asked – NO! Argh!Fatima eventually sorted these issues but it was very frustrating.The food at the restaurants was extremely good and so was the buffet. We didn’t try the Italian so can’t comment. The Thai was our favourite. The entertainment was OK but not many visitors went to see it| perhaps as the bar was not inclusive? This made the evening atmosphere a bit flat. The pool is fabulous but beware that there are lots of younger children in it – try the sea if you want more peace.So to sum it up| hotel fab| some staff rigid and unhelpful| some great. Food great| pool great| beach great. Too many very young children.,Johannesburg| South Africa,22-12-15,No,4
5 Star Hotel with a 7 Star Service!,We booked the beach Front Suite and we have been overwhelmed by the BeachComber Experience!Right from he start| upon arrival| the welcome is spotless and everything is explained in details. You cannot miss anything. We've been pleasantly surprised by the staff - any staff member at this resort is very very polite| always smiling and courteous. Always helpful and always doing the extra mile to make you happy ( Whether you are a local or a foreigner!) .The Room Is HUGE| the bathroom is breathtaking| the dip pool is a dream come true| the bed is a magnet that prevents you from getting out of it| once you are in - well| everything has been carefully planned and designed to make your stay delicious and memorable - and it has been memorable!We had dinner at the Oasis - Indian cuisine| which is just amazing - a mix of Mauritian and Indian Cuisine - a huge variety of dishes - Lots and lots of options for veggies too - countless sweet items as desert - i would need a day to write the Dining experience!Breakfast is also complete continental with Fresh Juice| Fresh Fruits| you name it| and you have it - with the legendary Mauritian Smile and courtesy. I would like to make a special note to express our gratitude to everyone who has contributed to make this resort a special one ( Back office people| maintenance people| Management| Engineers| designers - well just everyone!) You Guys ROCK! Keep on the excellent service level.Keep on with the excellent work - we will surely visit soon. Real Soon.Lots of love!!V & S,Johannesburg| South Africa,20-12-15,No,5
Good but needs better patron relations,Stayed here 3 times over the years. Have mixed feelings about 'package' type holidays. When you deal with Beachcomber you have to put in 'requests' for flight seating preferences| room availability| restaurants and so forth. Is it just me but when I am spending a substantial amount of money for a family of four holiday and am repeat business| I would think and hope you get the service and your requests treated with priority.Not the case. 3 emails to hotel with requests not read or dealt with| had to move rooms twice| met with front office manager on 1st day -Nicolas and was told the hotel would revert to me reference a important query -never attended too. Spoke to Nicolas on last night of stay and he was indifferent-passed the buck to FNB manager. At check in -no welcome drinks like other guests.Small issues like these make us wonder whether Beachcomber /Hotel actually want our patronage or should we go else where next time?Outside these issues the hotel is nice| good beach but as others have pointed out many beach vendors and lots of motor boats zooming up and down. Beach towels appear to be issued per room|once a day and not changed during day. Food at main buffet restaurant good but breakfast is repetitive and needs more flair. No fresh fruit juice.We had a family room in 400 block which was good. Rooms are a bit dark?Also why no fresh milk or at least capsules of milk in room for coffee. Powder milk in 5 star plus establishments really not on...Had an early morning flight and had to phone reception 3 times for porter service only to be told to carry on waiting -had to wait 30 min for said service.,Johannesburg| South Africa,19-12-15,No,4
Excellent to end our wonderful trip to Mauritius,The whole resort layout is extremely mesmerizing. Has good facilities in the resorts including all the sport facilities. I did played tennis one day| which the staff was happy to hook me another Swiss resident| who was also looking for a partner. F&B staff are the most hospitable. We eat all our dinner at the Indian restaurant| where our son was taken special care of. The Lunch and breakfast buffet spread is good but repetitive. My wife| a vegetarian| often complained lack of vegetarian options. Overall we were looking for relaxing place to end our wonderful trip and TAB was just what Doctor ordered.,New Delhi| India,15-12-15,No,4
Near to Paradise,This is an excellent hotel with all the features it should have. To summarize:Beach is very nice| no shoes required| water quality between good and excellent (depending on the number of boats cruising by - usually excellent in the morning deteriorating in the course of the day.)Hotel area excellent| no loud music during the night| very quiet for a perfect sleep.Restaurants are numerous (6) and food is very good on some evenings even as excellent as in a gourmet restaurant.Staff is very nice and always helpful.(Water) Sports are plenty and perfectly organizedWifi is good enough as long as you dont want to stream something...,Vienna| Austria,13-12-15,No,5
Excellent resort,Stunning grounds| excellent food| staff professional throughout. Clean| spacious and airy rooms...only saw one mozzy in ten days. Beautiful outdoor shower which we used every day and I think is a feature of all rooms. Of course there's an indoor one too. In addition the watersports centre is excellent. It's all included even the waterskiing/wakeboarding. The staff here are very helpful and enthusiastic and genuinely seemed pleased to teach and see results. The guys on the waterskiing pontoon deserve a special mention. Thanks for a great holidayAndy and Bea,Cambridge| United Kingdom,12-12-15,No,5
Tropical Paradise,This is my third visit to Trou aux Biches and on each occasion I cannot fault the experience. All round quality service| provided with a smile and in a most courteous manner. The hotel is set in splendid and well manicured grounds and is located on what must be one of the best beaches in the world. Although my visits have been on business the general ambience and relaxed feeling around the place makes every day feel like a holiday. Overseeing the whole operation | Fatima glides serenely around the premises making everyone feel special in a most courteous and professional manner. This hotel must be one of the world's treasures!,Cambridge| United Kingdom,12-12-15,No,5
Narrow strip of beach,I had a really great break here. I've never gone on a beach holiday alone before but various reasons I needed a break with some sun and sea air and decided to come to this place.I would say 80% of residents are couples and the remaining 20% family groups. I think I probably the only solo traveller| but that didn't really matter.Accommodation is great - I just has a standard villa room not too close to the sea| but great balcony and the pools they have build the accommodation around are great - the gardens are incredibly beautiful and its just such a nice place to hang out.I'd rate the breakfast only 7/10. One of the problems with Mauritius is they don't seem to grow oranges there so fresh orange juice is unavailable. Pretty good spread for breakfast| but could have been better in terms of fruit and cereal selections.I went to the Thai and Italian restaurants and would recommend both of these - really good food at both| very well presented and much better value than going for the standard buffet at the main restaurant. Staff and service was generally excellent. Wifi was pretty weak most of the time which was a bit annoying.The spa is very nice in terms of how it is set up and the facilities. I had a couple of massages there| they were fine but neither was in my top 25%. Beach here is nice but a bit narrow| especially when the tide is in. Also| if you are a keen swimmer you may be a bit frustrated because you can't swim out too far because of all the water sports along the front (waterskiing| etc.). Included in the rates are things like sailing. They have Hobby Cats that seem to be in very good conditions.I think the highlight for me was the gardens and the private pools. Really beautiful and tranquil. Oh and the gym is excellent too. The spa is also pretty nice.,London| United Kingdom,12-12-15,No,5
Great Surprise,"Not really ""resort"" people but wanted to give TAB a shot because of how great the beach looked. Exceeded all expectations. We were concerned that we could get lost in the shuffle due to the size of the property but everything was great. Especially a dinner at the Thai restaurant where a served by the name of Sunkur. He took such great care of us. Room and view were amazing. We were fortunate enough to stay in one of the suites with private pools which were perfect for the sunset. Would definitely come back again. Only slight complaint| wifi wasn't the best but with views and beach access like this you dont want to be on the internet for more than a few minutes.",Philadelphia| Pennsylvania,04-12-15,No,5
Stunning resort for our wedding and honeymoon,"We booked this hotel to get married at after looking at a number of different possibilities. On arrival we were greeted with fresh fruit and a drink after an hours drive from Port Louis airport. We were given a quick run through of the different restaurants/buffets and which offered what and when. Make sure you note this down as you won't remember it! The staff were friendly and welcoming and spoke both English and French fluently. We were upgraded to a jr suite which was very kind| and meant we had another room and bathroom across the hallway to our appt. The room was huge with an indoor and out door shower| bath and separate w.c. The room was fully equipt with the usual amenities and the back doors opened out onto a pool that was shared by our ""block""| but there was hardly ever anyone there so it may as well have been private. The grounds are well kept and mosquito spray was sprayed every few days however make sure you take your own repellent as well. The food at L'Oasis buffet was fantastic every night and the staff were all very friendly and well clued up on what everything was. In our opinion the Indian restaurant was the best with amazing staff| food and service. The deck is understaffed and wouldn't recommend| go to the Caravelle for lunch instead. We got married on the beach and our wedding planner took care of everything for us with everything turning out just as planned. The services offered included a hair and make up trial which were unexpectedly fantastic. The girls at the spa are very talented and listen to everything. The beach is close to all of the rooms and the resort is well located with it offering stunning sunsets and a short drive to Grand Baie were all of the shops and bars are. Taxis are expensive from the hotel but you can haggle down.... pretty much anything and everywhere which is brilliant. Make sure you double check your bill before you leave as we had a few mistakes but they were put right very quickly. I've already been recommending Trou Aux Biches to everyone and all of our guests that we had over absolutely loved it too.",London| United Kingdom,04-12-15,Yes,5
Paradise,Starting with a surprise upgrade from 2 junior suites to a 2 bedroom villa and ending with our final morning on the beach| this is one of the very best holidays we've had the privilege of enjoying.Every single staff member was delightful and efficient| our favourite waiter was Ravee at the main buffet. The Indian restaurant was our favourite eatery - delicious and interesting food| topped by great service and live| authentic Indian music. The food was good at all the restaurants| the only one we didn't try was the Italian.The villa was our little haven within a tropical garden paradise. The resort gardens are absolutely beautiful and well maintained.We spent every late afternoon playing tennis and table tennis before heading back for our last swim of the day and sunset on the beach. The staff manning the various sports were friendly| efficient and most enthusiastic about us enjoying ourselves.There isn't one single thing that I could criticise about this resort| it was our 3rd and best visit to Mauritius. We will definitely return to this Resort if we ever have the opportunity to travel to Mauritius again in the future.,Cape Town| South Africa,03-12-15,Yes,5
An absolutely amazing resort| the overall cost is significant though,We stayed at the resort for 6 nights| from 6th July to 12th July.Our credit card was taken on arrival and a hold placed on our credit card; unfortunately the reception staff placed a higher 'hold amount' on our credit card than what we requested| we were unable to remove the hold and place a smaller limit.We were upgraded to a tropical room on arrival which was a lovely surprise. The room was absolutely sensational.The facilities of the resort are excellent| and we made good use of the tennis courts| gym and awesome beach. We tried all the restaurants and the food was of a 'fairly good' quality. The food in the resort is expensive| which is to be expected| but more expensive than even the best restaurants in Australia| which is a little outrageous on reflection. I recommend you book the hotel restaurants in advance| otherwise you'll have to order room service (albeit quite good) as the restaurants fill up quickly. Overall| we had a very good experience at the hotel. I was slightly disappointed by some of the exorbitant pricing| and sometimes felt we were being taken advantage of by the pricing. As a once in a lifetime experience... it was probably worth it.,Durban| South Africa,26-11-15,Yes,4
Revisit Honeymoon,Great Location Hotel in Mauritius| Beautiful Beach and Ocean with magnificent Sun Sets| close to Grand Baie and just an exceptional Mauritian Beach Hotel| pity the food was not a good as our previous Honeymoon Trip.,Durban| South Africa,25-11-15,Yes,5
Had mixed feelings about this hotel,"My husband and I stayed her at the very end of our 5 week trip to several countries.It was suppose to be the ""icing on the cake""....ProsThe beach area was lovely| the white sandy beach stunning| with plenty of sun chairs and a wide variety of complimentary water sportsMost of the staff was polite| friendly and helpful especially a food service supervisor named Dean who when hearing my husband was in our room not feeling well offered to bring a complimentary dinner plate to him. He spotted me eating alone in the evening buffet. This was such a kind gesture| he clearly has a good knowledge of what customer service is all about.We were brought champagne in our room and had a wonderful candlelight dinner offered to us for our 33rd wedding anniversary which we appreciated.The large infinity pool is amazingConsThe woman who checked us in lied directly to me when she said the Dive building was not in our view. I had looked at a site map before we were taken to our room and I was concerned about the room she assigned us as it looked to have a building view. I was surprised to see the dive shop was in fact right in front of our window.The rooms are dark and large with a cold feeling. It would help if they brought some color into the rooms perhaps by painting a wall. They just gave a feeling of starkness. The only seating other than the bed were 2 functional chairs at a little table. The bedding and pillows were ""tired"" and looked and felt like they needed to be replaced. The bed itself was quite hard and not at all conducive to a good nights sleep. After the incredibly comfortable Hilton bed it was difficult to sleep soundly here....The breakfast was adequate but after experiencing the amazing breakfasts at the Hilton were disappointing. They were not kept filled| and felt more like a ""all you can eat"" family resturant meal. The grounds are very dark at night| there is lighting but it is subtle.Overall I knew right away we should have just spent all our weeks time at the Hilton and not moved| it almost seems this hotel ""try's to hard"" to be something it's not.....",Alaska,18-11-15,Yes,4
Very Bad Restaurant,"The dinner at the restaurant on the beach was poor. Very bad service| bad food quality and not acceptable for a 5 star hostel. We took a ""Saint Jacques Carpaccio"" for the starter which wasn't fresh and I had diarrhea following this meal. We took the lamb cutelets aswell which were well cookeed even though i ordered a medium rare one.",Cape Town Central| South Africa,15-11-15,Yes,1
Ambivalent,I really like the layout of the resort. The Caravelle bar and restaurant are right on the beach| the individual pools in each cluster of suites| the long beach. When we arrived we were taken to our junior suite which stank of damp and mould. The reason was soon clear - the showers have old wooden grates that look like a breeding ground for verucas. We ended showering in beach slops. When we asked to be moved because of the extreme damp smell the hotel reception was not very helpful and I had to get quite verbal for them to do anything. Eventually we were relocated to another suite near the Caravelle bar. Which unfortunately was on the access road between the main hotel area and the bar/restaurant - so we had golf carts buzzing past behind the unit from early till late. Not restful at all. The food at the Caravelle and Il Corallo was great. The Thai restaurant far less so and also very expensive for what you got. Avoid. ,Cape Town Central| South Africa,14-11-15,Yes,3
NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED! BETTER OPTIONS AVAILABLE?,My wife and I spent a week at Trou Biche resort in early November.The resort is attractive| well laid out and uniquely different with lovely gardens and trees.The room (junior suite) was comfortable |clean and different with the large open shower being one of the features and our sleep quality was generally good during our stay.Wi Fi reception is good and one can pick up signal around the pools and also in the room.The Restaurants provided good quality food and the Oasis buffet was largely good.The beach was attractive| clean and delightful with the exception of being continually hampered by beach traders which prompted us to move more into the private property to avoid their persistent and annoying efforts to sell something.Prices of food and drink were high and off putting in our opinion... avoid special Mauritius cocktails the hotel offer on special promotion($13.00) a glass which is a rip off!The service..housekeeping was good…room service very good…restaurants very average and a lot of the waitrons sullen and dissapointingly sad and nowhere near 5 star standard.All in all I suppose we were disappointed that we chose Trou Biche..A lovely designed Resort that lacks warmth and friendliness and expensive..there are better options on the Island that will not cost you as much !,Durban| South Africa,14-11-15,Yes,4
Perfect- loved it,Tomorrow is our last day in TAB. We thoroughly enjoyed it. It's our first trip without the kids and it exceeded expectations. The resort is simply stunning and had a perfect beach and surroundings. We had breakfast every morning by the pool and the staff especially Rajish could not enough to please us. We used the hobby cat everyday plus pedal I| kayaking every so often. The boat house staff were extremely helpful and friendly| a special mention goes to Sammy! Would love to come back with the kids. ,Surrey| England,12-11-15,Yes,5
Perfect Holiday ,We have just arrived home after a wonderful 11 night stay in a 3 bedroom family villa within Trou Aux Biches Resort Spa Hotel We had booked a two bedroom villa for us and our 3 sons| but upon arrival we were upgraded - which was a lovely surprise!We were met at the villa by a host of friendly staff who showed us around and explained everything to us| and made us| thirsty| weary travellers| a drink and helped to get us settled.The villa concept is not one we had heard of before - a villa within a hotel? It's BRILLIANT! - we had the pleasure of a wonderful lady called Sangeetah| to look after us| she made the most delicious breakfasts and kept everything beautifully clean and organised| and knew the answer to any question we had. She was kind and caring and we all fell in love with her. In fact| we all felt so cared for and looked after by her| I can honestly say she truly made our holiday| even more special.The villa itself was stunning and so well equipped - the bathroom in the master bedroom was such a wonderful surprise it took our breath away| it is a lovely big room with his and her sinks| a huge open rainfall shower| plenty of wardrobe space| well lit mirrors and.....a private outside bath ! Stunning! The kitchen was gorgeous| beautifully equipped with lots of gadgets| a stocked fridge - cola| water and sprite were all included and it was very easy to work out what were extras and what was included. The pool was great fun for the children tooThe resort itself was beautiful| well laid out| and manicured by friendly garden staffThe beach is exactly what you'd hope for / pure white sand and warm turquoise sea. Some of the beach sellers were still here| 10 years later (this was our third visit to TAB - we visited pre the big renovations| 9 and 10 years ago) We found the sellers to be friendly and easy to say no to| if we weren't interested. The restaurants were great| we only ate in the main| buffet style Oasis| a couple of times| preferring the more intimate smaller restaurants dotted around The two Sadeks who we first met 10 years ago are still there and have both had well deserved promotions and are to be found in the Italian and the fish restaurant called The Deck They couldn't have done more to make us feel welcome and the food was out of this world. (Special mentions to Dev and Dave too / who were both lovely ) we enjoyed legendary meals in both restaurants! The general organisation for restaurant bookings| and basically everything else under the sun was orchestrated by a lovely lady called Prateema. She made it her one woman mission to see that our holiday was running smoothly| that we felt looked after and that every need was catered for| and she succeeded with bells on! She even stayed late to say goodbye to us. We took the boys (age 18| 16 and 12) scuba diving| there's a dive centre within the hotel. Our youngest son was very apprehensive but Rajesh looked after him so well| and helped him overcome his fears in the water. I'd highly recommend an introductory dive| it was all filmed by Kelwin who also came with us and looked after us all. Get the DVD you won't regret it!We took advantage of two private evenings in the villa| arranged by Prateema| one was a bbq - a chef in a white chefs hat arrived and Sangeetah and him cooked up a storm ! Our table was beautifully laid and scattered with frangipani flowers| candles lit| and delicious bbq food prepared| and the second night was a traditional Mauritian meal - Sangeetah and this time| another lady helped| who was smily and friendly and they both spent ages in the kitchen preparing our dinner. I asked if they minded if I watched and of course| they didn't mind| so I got a cooking lesson too!  The evening was wonderful and a lovely memory to look back on. I'd definitely recommend anyone offered this| to take it up. The nights are a bit extra on your bill| but in my opinion they are worth every penny. The lady in charge of everything is called Fatima and she made a point of knowing our names and saying hello| which was lovely| as it just reinforced the whole friendly ethos of the hotel.We are planning our next trip already - serious withdrawal symptoms! ,Surrey| England,05-11-15,Yes,5
Luxury in Mauritius,We stayed at the Trou Aux Biches Resort over the weekend of 16-19 Oct as part of a combined engagement/birthday celebration. From arrival at the reception we were treated like royalty and our every whim and desire was catered for with minimum fuss. The main resort building and its connecting bars and restaurants is exceptionally slick and beautiful while still maintaining an island feel to it. We were placed in a really spacious sea facing room which had a large balcony area to relax on as well as both an outdoor and indoor shower area. Ideal for a romantic getaway.The white stretches of beach extend as far as the eye can see from the one end of the resort to the other. There are plenty of activities available for those who enjoy water activities and those who would prefer some tennis or beach volleyball. We paid a visit to the spa and the service there was exactly as one would expect for a 5 star hotel. There are a variety of international restaurants which cater for all pallets and the food and service is top class. My fiance's birthday fell on the Saturday that we were there and the staff were exceptional in making her feel very special. The manager on duty arranged a candlelit dinner for us and a birthday cake to close out proceedings. Really fantastic attention to detail.A neat feature which the resort has introduced is the lack of wifi on the beach and at bars and restaurants. This shows their commitment to making sure you relax and enjoy your time with them without distractions. Its certainly not geared for the business set. We thoroughly enjoyed the lack of technology throughout our stay.We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mauritius and especially those visiting the north of the island. The location is good as it's within a walk and taxi ride to Grand Baie. The streets are very safe and the people are so friendly. We loved walking round the town and also took the bus to Grand Baie from outside the hotel. You can hire a taxi for a small fare and they will take you to as many places as you want to go. The resort can also arrange for a transfer back to the airport when your stay is over.The general courtesy and hospitality of the local staff is a high testament to the impeccable standards which the resort adheres to. A special shout out to Dean (the manager in charge at the time) and his catering to our every need. Its left a lasting memory in our minds and we will definately recommend the hotel to friends and family. We aim to return as soon as possible. Thanks to each of those that made our stay so fantastic.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,05-11-15,Yes,5
fullfilled all my excpectings!,We had a family suite where we had enough space for all of us 4. There are 6 restaurants in the resort all of them work with fresh and high quality products. My favorite was the La Caravelle. The food there is french with a touch of Mauritius| The Deck is also good with mainly seafood. The Oasis has always a buffet with a various choice if u don`t know what to eat.... the beach is breathtaking. There are alway people treeing to sell there stuff( tunics| bracelets etc. there are not mean! but u should deal the price!!! the products they have are ok . Specially the pares and tunics. But u find them all again in any touristic location. Excursion Ile des cerfs is with it although it is extremely busy over there. Excursion Ile de demux coco is so beautiful. You have to trie. The cocktails all over the island are delicious!!! Enough alcohol also for guys.... Also trie to discus the price for boat experiences or so. But be carefull it is not like in Marrakech. The garden and the pools are so beautiful...go and see. I will return!,Vienna| Austria,04-11-15,Yes,5
Wedding Anniversary,We booked this Hotel for our 30th wedding anniversary for 2 nights. Our room was on the 1st floor on the 2nd row facing the sea. We had a good view from the terrace. Room was nice| spacious| quiet and bathroom was excellent.Buffet was served in the main restaurant with a wide variety of food for dinner. A special cake was served in our room on this occasion. Sports Centre is very well equipped and a long stroll along the 2km beach was also a good exercise twice daily. A late check-out was kindly offered by the management. Staff was good and we were well looked after.,MAURITIUS,01-11-15,Yes,5
Simply Paradise,We stayed at Trou aux Biches Resort in October for 7 nights. The hotel is beautiful| the grounds are well maintained and set on a beautiful sandy beach. We were in the tropical junior suite which was very spacious| cleaned well every day in the morning and in the evening the bathroom was tidied up and fresh towels left for us. Beach towels are also provided. Nice bathroom products but disappointed that body lotion was not included.We were on half board and the food was delicious!. The hotel has an international restaurant which is buffet style (Oasis)| Indian| Thai| Mediterranean and Italian. Apart from the International restaurant you have to book a table for the others and we did not encounter any problems doing this and had a meal at all the restaurants. The food is of good quality and even the fussiest eaters will find something to eat. We are vegetarians and found all the restaurants very helpful and accommodating - the Thai and Indian restaurant created a vegetarian menu for us so thank you for that and the other restaurants had a separate menu. We loved Mauritian night and wished they would have this more than once a week.What also makes this hotel a lovely place to stay is the staff. Very courteous| always ready with a greeting| be it ground| reception or restaurant staff. It was nice that guest relations came to us on numerous occasions to ensure we we were enjoying our stay and we had a request for them once which was dealt with immediately.Whilst we were there my husband and I celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary and it was so nice of them to have set up a special table for us with a card and presented us with a special anniversary cake - it was a lovely touch so thank you again.Can I please say a big thank you to Ouma| Ravi| Menon| Dave and I'm sure there are others too for the service you gave us. I would like to make a special mention of Ouma who really did go out of her way for us. We had mentioned to her that we liked cassava and she had totally surprised us by speaking to the chef who bought the cassava specially for us and cooked it how we like it - so thank you chef and Ouma you are a star!We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mauritius. The location is good as it's within a town. Mauritius and very safe and the people are so friendly. We loved walking round the town and also took the bus to Grand Baie from outside the hotel. You can hire a taxi for the day or half day and they will take you to as many places as you want to go and bring you back for a set price. Outside the hotel there is a tour company which we used to book a personal one day tour.,United Kingdom,01-11-15,No,5
Beautiful but somehow lacking,Visited in early 2000's and in 2013| but now looking at visiting Mauritius again and finding it hard to commit to Beachcomber Trou aux Biches. It is a fabulous location| superb beach| luxurious and great snorkelling| and the rooms are good. The food especially buffet dinners way below old (unrenovated Trou aux Biches) standard| and very much basic hotel food. The resort is now much bigger and I imagine it is difficult to manage the food standards when catering for such large numbers of people. The management were very kind and Fatima went out of her way to help us - but for South African travellers this is an expensive option and one leaves missing the special intimate Mauritian feel that the old hotel had. Hope they are able to add some Mauritian touches and food to the menu and surrounds again - maybe a la carte is better| or a buffet selection which is smaller and more Mauritian.,Cape Town| South Africa,01-11-15,No,4
Paradise ruined by appalling service - feeling so disappointed!,I was so excited to be returning to Mauritius after an absence of nearly 7 years. We booked a Beachfront suite with it's own plunge pool which was great. The suite was spacious| but very dark (no natural lighting and all lights on one circuit). The bathroom and outside shower just beautiful! The beach is magnificent - paradise! Unfortunately though the service in the restaurants and Oasis bar is almost non existent. On arrival you are shown to a table and then the wait starts for someone to take a drinks order - it was so frustrating. I like to receive my drinks then go and decide what I will be eating - I would have finished my dinner by the time the wine arrived! Also in the Oasis restaurant my husband asked one of the chefs if he could have a sliced tomato - well this was impossible! Until he complained then there was action and Jerome F&B manager arranged a lovely dinner for us at La Caravelle - they really went overboard which was very nice but all we really wanted was normal restaurant service! The following night we went to the Italian restaurant and waited 40 minutes for a menu - eventually walking out! I'm really shattered by the total lack of interest in the expected level of service! The only exception to the shocking service was the beach trolley! Jocelyn and Sadish (sp?) were fantastic! There appears to be an organisational problem as you never know who your waiter is - I tried to get into the habit when shown to a table to request the name of the waiter who would be taking our order and clearing our table| but this was also too difficult a task for them to answer! There were so many other instances of shocking service but it would take me all night to write! This is definitely my last visit to Trou aux Biches - this was or 5th Beachcomber holiday (2 x Paradis| 2 x Trou aux Biches and 1 x La Victoria) and have never experienced anything like this. ,Knysna| South Africa,30-10-15,No,2
Dream honeymoon,My wife and I spent 7 days as our Honeymoon in the “Trou aux Biches Hotel Resort” on Mauritius. Our rooms were marvelously cleaned every day. We also had towel service twice a day so that we always had fresh towels once we came back to our room. Since this trip was our honeymoon we upgraded to the “Tropical Junior Suite” with half-board in this resort. We had the opportunity to reserve tables in the many available restaurants on the campus. Since the hotel had reached only 50% capacity during our stay it was not all to complicated to reserve a table| however on the weekends table for the preferred time (8pm) were always already booked. The restaurants itself always served delicious food. But| my wife and I can’t recommend the “international restaurant”| as half-board guests need to co-pay for 90% of the offered dishes. Also| the international character was rather “french” oriented than “international”. Nevertheless| we would like to recommend to any guest to visit the “Italien restaurant” (Il Corallo). Best food and unforgettable service.For us| the breakfast was the highlight of our stay in this hotel/resort. Each morning we had the breakfast at the little pool-island. Additionally| Rajesh and Vinay made our morning special as they always welcomed us with a smile and always had a helpful recommendation what to do that day. Also| their service was outrageous so that we can recommend them for a raise. Here| we would also like to use the opportunity to send them our warmly greetings.,Stuttgart| Germany,29-10-15,Yes,5
Your dream venue.,My wife and I stayed at this wonderful resort in October 2015.We were relocated here from another hotel on the island which wasn't ready (that's another story) but although this hotel was not related to our booked hotel| the staff here did everything they could to make things right and to cater for all our needs. Melanie on reception was fantastic| she made it her personal quest to ensure we were kept up to speed on how things were progressing and managed to ease us into what became a dream holiday.The hotel resort is immaculate in every way. The design compliments its surroundings which is evident in the amount of wildlife and foliage that moves and grows around the resort.The facilities are amazing and plentiful. The choice of restaurants and cuisine will suit every taste. We stayed for 10 days and never had a bad meal.The rooms. Wow the rooms! We were initially put up in a garden view room| which certainly had the wow factor| with walk in shower| his and her wash basins and a huge bath. Massive comfortable bed| loads of space and a lovely balcony.After two days we were moved into a beach front suite to see the rest of our stay out in. we were both pretty much dumb struck. We have stayed in some lovely places all over the world from Riu hotel resorts to Sofitel hotels all 5* but this room along with everything that went with it was simply superb. Too many things to list but try the plunge pool on your private patio| the even bigger walk in shower| inside and outside!detail like| an espresso machine| a gentle humming ac system that you could keep on all night without being woken up by rattle and erratic temp changes.The beach front from resort end to end was immaculate and truly beautiful| just what you would expect from Mauritius| palm trees| white sand and clear ocean.Whether you walked along the sandy beach or along the palm canopy of the resort footpath every view was stunning.The resort is big enough to lose yourself in whatever world suits you but without being remote. Each cluster of accommodation has its own pool for a bit of peace and quiet or be entertained around the main pool and people watch. I can't comment on the entertainment as we kept ourselves up the quiet end of the beach| not that the resort is loud. You don't get the constant distant boom boom boom from an over excited dj just a distant reminder that there is something going on if you want it.We frequented the 'La Caravelle' bar and restaurant as they were up our end of the resort. The Italian restaurant is also there.La Caravelle bar is a must for relaxing aperitifs or after dining cockails. Gunshee| the manager will spoil you rotten so that you won't go anywhere else. His staff will mix your cocktail to just how you like it and are very attentive without being in your face. there is entertainment every night there too. Nice soothing piano playing to fun songs we all know but all kept to a volume you don't have to shout over. The only problem here was that they finished too early. Around 10 - 10.30pm. Though the bar stayed open a lot later.During the day| if you're like my wife| you'll lie on a comfortable sunbed and read in between dips in the sea. If you're like me then you'll take full advantage of the water sports on offer all of which are free except for the scuba diving. that includes water ski| sailing| and lots more.I spent most of my time with the guys on the water ski. Vissen will take good care of you and teach you how to do anything you want to do on the water so long as its being dragged by a boat! In fact all the guys there are great and very professional which makes you feel very safe.I have only mentioned three individual members of staff who were great| but believe me when I say all the staff are there to make your stay as comfortable as they can make it| from the men tending to the flowers to Fatima the resorts executive assistant manager| who will always remember your name and with her beautiful smile| always make you feel special.Tips for your stay. I would suggest you book all your restaurants and water sport activities as soon as you get there. Try them all then book your favourites again.Try and get the best package you can from either Beachcomber or your travel agent. We went with Tropical Sky who are brilliant and give a great personal service too.The resort operate a full board plus package which still has its limitations so if you want more either negotiate or take another £1000k with you for those extravagant extras and champagne! We did that in ten days but really enjoyed ourselves!Enjoy| it would be impossible not to.Peter Adams.,New York City| New York,27-10-15,Yes,5
OUTSTANDING!!!!,Just got back from Honeymoon| friendliest people| outstanding facilities| great 5 star cuisine!! Fatima and her team can take proud in what they are doing!! Doing an outstanding job!Room is very comfortable and clean. I recommend this hotel to any person travelling to Mauritius. Trou aux biche you have won my heart!,Johannesburg| South Africa,27-10-15,Yes,5
August holiday,Lovely swimming beach| superb waterskiing| plus other watersports| tennis and spa. Great to have a choice of six restaurants. The politest and nicest staff. Hot sun during the day but cooler in the evenings and no humidity was fantastic. Also highly recommend Susie Freeman Travel for easy booking and attention to detail.,Newbury| United Kingdom,26-10-15,Yes,4
Amazing hotel!,This was our third stay at the hotel and we would certainly return. The location is perfect with a stunning beach. The hotel restaurants offer a wide range of cuisines and the staff are brilliant - truly professional and always welcoming. Special thanks goes to Jerome| Sailesh and Hans who went that extra mile to perfect our stay. Benito makes the best cocktails! The spa is out of this world with a variety of unique treatments. All in all - a perfect holiday! We will be back!,York,26-10-15,Yes,5
A beautiful hotel| worth the trip!,The hotel and the beach are some one of the most beautiful| I've ever been too!Very clean. The employees are very polite; the restaurants are great.The Thai and indian restaurants are my favorite ones! The only minor remarks: breakfast stops at 10:00 a.m... a pity :-)The beverage prices are comparable to European ones. It was a beautiful honeymoon stay!I recommend!,Luxembourg,24-10-15,Yes,5
Top Honeymoon spot with all the perks.,I cant give this hotel enough credit.It is just perfect. Me and my husband decided to spend ten days at this amazing resort and we initially booked for the pool suite facing the ocean and because it was our honeymoon they gave us a room upgrade| we booked half board and they included a free lunch from the buffet restaurants everyday| a couples spa and we were both given a free gift from the hotel shop.The food in the many restaurants was spectacular and of the beat quality| the staff and the entertainment were superb. I can not fault the service from the staff at all. They were so warm pleasant and friendly and always happy to help. I had the choice to choose to go anywhere in the entire world and i chose Mauritius because of its beautiful beaches| where you get to relax and you also get to explore the beautiful island. Many activites to get involved with and a sense of culture which surrounds you. Mauritius people were the best i have ever experienced in my many years of foreign travel. The hotel is situated in a quiet resort| just what me and my husband needed after a busy and stressful year of wedding planning. The popular resort of grand baie is a short bus journey of about 15 mins and there you can find an array of shops restaurants| clubs but the beach there isnt as pleasant. Trou aux biches beach was one of the best on the whole island so everyone told me and what what i researched. The hotel has left me with fond memories of my honeymoon which i will cherish forever. Thank you beachcomber. ,Birmingham| United Kingdom,19-10-15,Yes,5
Perfect beach nice resort but too big,This resort has the best beach of Mauritius. But the resort is a bit too big for our liking. This makes the atmosphere a bit unpersonal the staff was not as friendly a you would expect in a five star resort. The rooms are great but overlooking one of the 5 or something Pools and no view of the ocean. The ocean is a couple of minutes walk away.The beach hawkers were quite annoying. But we had some great sunsets over here. We did like the food very much great restaurants especially the Indian an italian. We didn't like the watersports very much. We did the snorkling inside the reef because it was too windy outside. That was not good. The sailing is restricted to a small area so also not very Nice. ,Groningen| The Netherlands,17-10-15,Yes,4
Breathtaking,Trou aux Biches is by far my favorite Mauritian hotel. The rustic feel to its design is exactly what I love. The food was beautiful.The beach is spectacular. The friendliness received from the staff is ground breaking.An outdoor shower at this hotel is like no other. I love Trou aux Biches. ,Johannesburg| South Africa,12-10-15,No,5
Lovely| Large resort complex,"We stayed here for a week following a week in Wolmar at a much smaller resort...the resort is beautifully laid out with groupings of four rooms per building.....2 up and 2 down..we were downstairs and had a wonderful outdoor shower attached to our large bath...we also had a walk out patio....the room is average size with a couple of chairs| bed and writing table....very little storage ...closet in bathroom with limited shelves with two baskets.....toilet is in separate space in bathroom.....nice but nothing fancy....pools were everywhere....main pool is amazing| but COLD in September......beach is lovely with chairs and some umbrellas.....too many people ""save"" seats and never show up...not a good policy to enforce.....towels should be removed....there are tooooooooo many sales persons constantly hounding you to buy their junque......they even sit on chairs and chat with each other......the water sports are great....plenty of boats and free trips....food was good....had breakfast and free lunch daily....never ate dinner there.......the bathroom needs body lotion and wash cloths...we liked this hotel but it was really too big for my liking.....service was ok in dining room.....Rom cleaners were great.....I would recommend this hotel if you like a very large property.....GREAT gift shop",Boston| MA| USA,11-10-15,No,4
5* experience overall,Thank you for a fantastic stay at this amazing ( jaw-dropping beautiful) resort. My husband and I shared a Senior suite and the hotel kindly put my 2 teenage sons in a room behind ours. The rooms were super comfortable| very private and conveniently placed near the volleyball net and swim area. The boys used our pool during the day after they played volleyball with newly made friends. I enjoyed every dinner we had at the various restaurants. The staff are friendly and helpful. In the Indian restaurant| the musician took the time and showed my boys how to play the Santur. Another skill my eldest mastered was hobicat sailing under the friendly guidance of the Boathouse crew. One evening they gave us a Fire show. These guys must be acrobats. They were really good. Even the Sega dancers were entertaining. I found the entertainment in the restaurants of high standard and classy. For families with teenagers or little ones| this place is heaven. It was like meeting a celeb when I met the well known Fatima. She is sincerely interested in everyone's well-being. They offered our rooms to us till 2 pm when the taxi came to pick us up. So| we could still swim in the ocean| eat lunch and had a shower. We only had a week of holiday. You need more than a week to enjoy everything that is offered. ( I've booked through Simplytravel. Kim did an amazing job to sort everything out in a short period of time.) ,Welkom| South Africa,11-10-15,No,5
Beautiful hotel in paradise with first class service,"We recently spent two weeks at this magnificent hotel and had a fantastic experience from start to finish. Special mention to the incredible level of service and professionalism and especially Jerome the Front of House manager as below.The location is perfect| with a beautiful white sand beach across as a massive wide frontage| meaning plenty of well spaced sun loungers| barely ever more than a single line deep so an unobstructed view over the calm lagoon out to the reef. Despite the hotel being nearly full we never felt like it was busy due to the fact that this hotel was one of the first in Mauritius so they bagged the widest stretch of one of the best beaches.The quality and design of the hotel was top notch. The rooms are spacious| clean and modern with lovely outside showers in the tropical suites and huge bathrooms and beds being a great feature. The common areas really set it apart with lovely decking everywhere and pools of water making little oasis and walkways that lend a touch of class.Services and facilities were great with brilliant watersports all included (including snorkeling trips to the reef) and a great dive school on site (I went on 2 dives with them about £35 per dive| saw a turtle on the first and a dolphin on the second....amazing!). Immaculate Tennis courts| god shop| everything you need.Food was incredible! We have been to alot of all inclusive's and had some great food| but this was in a different class! The buffets were very good with lots of variety and high quality| but the a la carte's were even better. Sometimes these can be hit and miss with the quality (understandably) due to the unfamiliarity with that cuisine (Italian on the other side of the world etc) and simply are a fairly plain room with a themed menu and some decoration. But these restaurants got it just right| wonderful food and very well cooked in beautiful surroundings| a credit to any top notch restaurant in the UK.. Special mention must go to the Thai Restaurant 'Blue Ginger' and the manager Hans. The food here was delicious and very authentic| in very atmospheric surroundings with impeccable service from a highly professional team. We had a special dinner here as we got engaged on this trip| and the restaurant were amazing. Ordinarily they have an (excellent) set menu| however my now fiancee is a huge fan of Thai red curry so I asked if there was any chance......and sure enough Hans's team prepared a delicious red curry especially for us and delivered it in a way that made us feel so special and looked after| thanks again Blue Ginger.It was this level of service and professionalism that really made this hotel shine and set it apart from other 5 star hotels| which all had great design and investment in the hotel itself. It was present in every aspect and really made the difference. This was a credit to the excellent management team led by Fatima the general manager who was always on hand and happy to help.| and all the staff who were consummate professional throughout.I must make particular mention of the star of the show| the Front of House Manager Jerome who is responsible for this level of service and standards throughout| but went above and beyond this. I had planned on the trip to propose to my now fiancee on the beach with some candles i had brought with me| and was hoping for some assistance with carrying out the surprise from the hotel. Jerome surpassed all my expectations| helping me plan an elaborate and beautiful surprise| building on my idea of candles by coming up with idea of un-prompted!) and providing paper lanterns| tall candles and creating a wonderful scene on the beach without my even asking for it. He then helped me arrange the special meal i mentioned| ensured the beach was guarded while we dined| arranged drinks and to have a lovely song playing when it all happened. Everything was ""no problem"" and carried out with a smile and professionalism that I came to see everywhere at beachcomber. And to top it all off my fiancee said yes as well which helped!!Thankyou again Jerome| Fatima| Hans and all at Trous aux Biche for making our stay truly memorable.",Leeds| United Kingdom,11-10-15,Yes,5
Short break in Mauritius,"I haven't been to Mauritius for about 5 years and friends and family decided to have a short break in October.The staff were very accommodating and reallocated us rooms closer to the pool so that our 11 year old was closer to the ""action"".Our beachfront rooms were really spacious and very well designed.Beautiful big bathroom with outdoor shower.Probably amongst the best rooms we have stayed in ever.The food was OK and a bit disappointing.We ate at the Thai restaurant one night and was not very good at all.Pool service was slow|and dont think we ever found a waiter close by to serve us|and always had to go and find one.The internet was shocking|in spite of complaining to the GM and the IT manager.It connected at 0|5Mbps at best and never got better.Almost impossible to get any work done|and was a source of frustration.I am not sure why hotels do this?Mauritius has a really good IT infrastructure.Otherwise|restful|expensive and relaxing.",Cape Town,11-10-15,Yes,4
Perfect Paradise Destination,We had the most amazing honeymoon at the Troux Aux Biches Resort and Spa! The staff were exceptional| warm| friendly and efficient - on point| from reception right through to our wonderful housekeeper Natacha. Particularly need to mention Anwar and Sandeck who gave us incredible care and attention| along with their amazing teams| specifically want to mention; Devi| Toolsy| Deepak| Ravi| Oomah and Heyman and special thanks to Fatima for always smiling with us and for her driving skills on the way to the spa. The food was outstanding| five star| mouth watering and quite remarkable meal after meal thanks to Julio and Mario and their fabulous team. What a beautiful island with beautiful people. We would love to return and probably will. Thank you so much!,Budleigh Salterton| United Kingdom,08-10-15,Yes,5
Still our favourite hotel,"This was our third visit to Trou aux Biches and we thoroughly enjoyed our room| the food and gardens. We were a little concerned that there appears to be the need to restore some rooms to the high level of quality we experienced in the past. TV not working| sliding door without a handle was a problem in our room. Another annoying aspect was the ""early bird green towel brigade"". A high number of towels were strategically placed on beach and pool loungers and the owners did not appear for several hours in some cases not at all all day. The beach attendants should remove these green towels if left unattended after one or two hours or forbid this practice completely. One final irritation was the number of excess times we were asked for our room number at meals. On the positive side the beach was great and the hotel is located in an excellent part of Mauritius.",Knysna| South Africa,07-10-15,Yes,4
Amazing Vacations!,The hotel is absolutely beautiful! The staff received us with cold drinks and fresh fruits and took care of all check in for us while we were already admiring the hotel. After that| a golf cart took us to the room. We had 2 rooms (because we have two children and the family room was not available) next to each other and in front of a beautiful and large garden. It was also very close to one of the restaurants entrance and the beach. It was not necessary to be calling the golf cart. Spacious and comfortable rooms and great big bathrooms.On our first night we had dinner at the buffet restaurant. The food is good and has variety. But does not compare to the flavor of the other hotel restaurants that require reservations. It is mandatory on arrival to make reservations where you would like to dinner and they worth it! We did not try the restaurants at lunch because we were out most of the day (the island has many beautiful things to see).The breakfast was also served in the buffet restaurant. With a little bit of everything. Every morning they had a kind of a cake (like a bread style one). But my son only wanted the vanilla one served on our first day! There was no problem with that: the staff was always ready to find some more of it at the back of the restaurant! The pool area is very beautiful and quiet. In fact| it is impossible to walk without stopping for several photos and admire such beauty . The beach also is very good and has various activities included. We made pedal boat| kayak| ski and a boat with glass bottom (maybe this ride is a little bit longer that we thought it would be). On the beach we also rented a float pulled by a speedboat. All very good! The beach is not private| but almost. You should expect one or other to try to sell you something| but that´s ok! Amazing vacations!,Rio de Janeiro| RJ,07-10-15,Yes,5
Disappointing,"My husband and I have stayed at many 5* hotels and resorts and I have to say TAB is not 5*. I think the thing that let them down was food and the attitude from some of the staff. When you go to a paradise island| you imagine eating fresh local fruit and fish and local dishes. Instead TAB served unripe fruit I could buy at Sainburys - oranges| kiwis| strawberries and pears. Rather than the papaya| coconuts and mango you'd expect. We had dinner at Caravelle which was average to say the least. My husband had drippy raw scallops with beetroot to start followed by over cooked lobster which stuck to the shell and was an hour late. The breakfast buffets had flies all over them| no effort to cover the food. The food was over cooked and coldThe ""Deck"" was the fish restaurant and the local dishes were delicious but the portions were tiny. The children's menu was basically everything breaded| deep fried with chips. I asked for some vegetables to accompany my son’s dinner and was told “I know you order vegetables on the side in Europe| but we don’t do that here”. We ordered room service a lot because we had two poorly boys and dinners didn’t seem to start till 7pm which is late for toddlers. Every single time the food arrived cold. I mean our room was right next to Caravelle where room service came from and yet it arrived cold!The bathroom in our suite was wonderful - outside shower as well as inside rain shower with a lovely big bath tub. The bed though| was too soft and you could feel the springs when you turned over. The lighting was awful| one switch turned them all on. So all in all| a rather disappointing stay at what had been recommended to us a brilliant resort with great cuisine. We shall not be giving the same recommendation sadly.",London| United Kingdom,07-10-15,Yes,2
Family Friendly,Lovely resort with accommodating staff who do their best to look after you.The breakfast is ok but not as great as it could be when comparing with some of the Thai resorts.The pool and gym facility is great and a superb spot to stay if you are into Tennis.Staff are friendly and helped accommodate by making baby friendly food as well!Do hire a car as its a lot easier to get around and check out the neighboring areas.,Berkshire| United Kingdom,03-10-15,Yes,4
The perfect mixture of family holiday meets luxury,If you dream of a luxury holiday but think it is not possible now you have children you have to head to Trou Aux Biches. It is the perfect place to spend time as a family but also gives you the chance to spend some time as a couple thanks to their amazing children’s club and laid back feel. We were travelling with our 1 year old and it was genuinely relaxing which is saying something when you have a toddler with you!Our holiday was arranged through Susie Freeman Travel who I can't recommend highly enough. Susie got to know us before recommending hotels to us. Her name came up on so many TripAdvisor reviews as someone who truly knows Mauritius. Not only did Susie go above and beyond to give us a holiday to remember| so did the hotel because of their close relationship with Susie. Everyone knew our names| our dietary requirements and preferences.Not only does the hotel have its main pool but it also has various pools dotted amongst the suites. We had the pool near us all to ourselves on several occasions and could truly relax and enjoy our time as a family. In case you want to sneak off to the spa (or down the road to get your teeth whitened as I did)| the kids club and the nannies there are great. We didn’t even get a backward glance from our little boy| which is always a good sign. The kids club will even take the children to the restaurant for their evening meal and then take them back to your suite to put them to bed and look after them. Having never left our son with anyone other than family it was a nervous time for me| but the nanny really did make me feel confident that he was being very well looked after and we enjoyed an evening out just the two of us for the first time since having him!One thing that really stood out for us at Trou aux Biches was the service. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with cold towels| cocktails and fruit we felt at home. In all of the restaurants the staff were fantastic as was the food. We had a knock at the door one evening and champagne and warm nibbles were delivered. It’s was little touches like this that really let you enjoy your time there and relax. The spa is a must of you want to get into that relaxed holiday mood straight away. The spa setting is so peaceful and tranquil. It’s worth having a massage simply for the chill out room you get to relax in afterwards! Again another part of the hotel that I instantly felt at home in and can't wait to go back to.We travel a lot and don't tend to often return to places but Trou Aux Biches is somewhere we can't wait to go back to and of course we will book through Susie again.,Berkshire| United Kingdom,27-09-15,Yes,5
Paradise on earth,"My husband and I came for our wedding anniversary. Last year we were on the South Eastern side| so we decided this time to try the North Western side. In terms of quality| comfort and atmosphere| there is nothing to fault this hotel. The beach and light blue sea are spectacular and picturesque.Various water sports are available free of charge and there is a well equipped sports and gym centre.The food is world- class with 6 awesome restaurants to choose from including Indian| Thai| Italian and Mauritian cuisine.The staff are very helpful and friendly and have been very well trained.It is difficult to make a comparison with Shandrani ( where we spent our honeymoon)- I think the hotel itself ( of Trou aux Biches) is more luxurious and modern and the setting is slightly better. The only downside is that there is not a "" fully inclusive"" package offered like at Shandrani.",Johannesburg| South Africa,26-09-15,Yes,5
Great beach| good food| improvable service,"We stayed here a week during our honeymoon in a Junior suite with garden view. Due to the honeymoon special we could upgrade our half board to full board which is really comfortable. We'd anyway recommend at least half board as dining outside the resort is difficult.Let's start with the greatest thing about this hotel: it is the long sandy beach. The room was really clean and huge. For food our clear recommendation is ""La Caravelle"". The other restaurants are OK| but nothing special. Unfortunately restaurant service suffers when a lot of guests are there. Our impression was that there is simple not enough personnel| which is true for the whole resort.The worst experience was check-in and check-out: We chose a different room directly when checking in. It took the hotel 3 days that this got reflected everywhere and we got our honeymoon vouchers etc. When checking out we had to wait 30 minutes until our luggage got finally delivered to the reception - our taxi was waiting already 20 minutes until we could finish the check-out procedures.",Schwetzingen| Germany,23-09-15,Yes,4
Heaven and angles looking after you,Excellent place to stay. The beach is clean and nice sunset view from the Swimming pool.The staff are so nice. Big thanks to the manager Fatima| she is welcoming the guests at check-in herself and looking after every single issue related to our stay. She is the right person to the right position. Blue Safari is just 15 minutes walking distace.Variety of restaurants and nice food.Our stay was amazing and enjoyable. I woud definitly recommend Beachcomber resorts for holidays and Honeymoon. You must try it.,Reading| United Kingdom,23-09-15,Yes,5
Heaven!,This is a great hotel on a fantastic beach. We had a family suite which was huge - 2 bedrooms & 2 bathrooms.We tried all the restaurants & we found the quality of the food (and wine) to be of consistently high quality.,Reading| United Kingdom,16-09-15,Yes,5
Unbelievable,This place is amazing. Perfect for the whole family of a couples retreat. Diligent staff| they are like friendly elves. They anticipate your needs brilliantly and go about the set upon goal with smiles all around. Great food. Super clean facilities. Unimaginably beautiful. Loads of activities. Heavenly.,London| United Kingdom,15-09-15,Yes,5
Stunning resort,First visit to Mauritius - we chose this resort because of the specious villa | sports facility| kitchen and lovley beach. We were not disappointed. Its a big resort with smaller beach front villas as well larger ones at the back. The beach is beautiful and soft white sand. From the time we arrived| the staff at the resort looked after our family really well. As we are vegetarians| the restaurant staff prepared extra food for our family during lunch every day. Most of the water sports are included in the cost of the resort and guys who run them are really friendly. Also there are 6 tennis courts| table tennis| badminton and a gym at the resort. Again really helpful and friendly staff. I hired the hotel limo for a day trip round the island. Costs a little more than the normal taxi| but well worth the extra money as they can very knowledgeable about all the sites.What impressed me most about this resort was that ALL the staff made everything possible. Thank you to ALL the team at Trou aux Biches,London| United Kingdom,12-09-15,No,5
Book your restaurant for dinner at the time of hotel reservation!,The room is quite small & looks too cramp. We didn't like the fact that we had to book restaurants for dinner. We were not told that we had to do this at the time of reservation and by the time we reached the hotel| we couldn't eat at the Thai or Italian restaurant as these were already booked for the week. We stayed there for only 2 nights but sadly couldn't enjoy the Italian and Thai cuisine.,Mauritius,12-09-15,No,3
Beautiful Resort with Great Amenities,Truly a great resort to have a family gathering. We reserved a 3 bedroom Villa and a Junior Suite for our family get together and we were all very satisfied. The Villa comes with a butler| private small pool| bar-b-que and a full kitchen.,New York| New York| United States,07-09-15,No,5
A hotel that checks all the boxes,Staying at this hotel was a lovely experience| the rooms were designed well| the food was great and the staff worked really hard to provide good service. It is a pity that I did have a few small problems whilst staying at this resort. Like my room door would not open a few times| the bathroom plug was broken| the batteries for both the safe and the television remote had to be changed. Small things that are just annoying and that could be avoided. But as soon as I mentioned the problems they were fixed accordingly. But I did feel safe staying at this resort and I still had a great trip,cape town,07-09-15,No,4
Great time at at great resort,We were four couples staying at the hotel and this resort has offered the weekend gateway we were looking for :) spacious room| Fantastic pool| delicious food and friendly staff. And ya very good Wifi.Overall a nice resort for a perfect breakout,mauritius,06-09-15,No,4
Absolutely stunning resort...look no further!,We booked a Family suite in this resort as we had two kids with us age 4 and 7.The rooms were quite big.| massive bathroom and outdoor shower was out of this world. Our two kids were always in the kids club..staff in the kids club were very professional and caring..they take the kids for swimming and do lots of other fun activities with them and even take children for lunch and dinner so you don't have to worry for them at all. They even arranged for our daughter's 7th birthday with cake and balloons in the kids club which was great and that also free of charge.The resort itself is very beautiful and picturesque and top of that the staff proves to be the big asset of the resort| always smiling and willing to help. I would like to mention DEAN from Guest Relations who were always there for us during our whole stay...thanx for everything Dean. I am vegetarian so something special was always made for me In the restaurants| special thanx to the chef of the Oasis restaurant for Indian Tea and alloo Parathas. TOOLSI from Oasis Buffet restaurant is a star..impressed by his hospitality. We also tried Indian and Italian restaurant which were also excellent. Fatima| the manager of the resort always on the rounds talking to everyone about their stay. We would no doubt visit again- ARORA Family. Room 318.,London| United Kingdom,04-09-15,No,5
Honeymoon Paradise. Thank You all at Trou Aux Biches Resort and Spa,We stayed at the Beachcomber Resort for 9 Nights following our Wedding in August.Quote frankly| this was truly fantastic| and the resort ticked all the boxes to make the Honeymoon that extra bit special.We were staying on Half Board basis| and was catered for very well in the many restaurants. Breakfast and Lunch options were vast| serving fresh Salads and Seafood| to BBQ's and fresh pizza. It was certainly not the time to worry about a diet.Our Tropical Suite| was possibly the best room in which we have ever stayed in. The view to the Tropical Pool was out of this world| the mini bar was always well stocked| and the King Size bed| was exactly what it says it was. There was enough room for me and my wife twice over| and was of the utmost comfort.Outside Shower. Amaaaaaaaaaazing Possibly my favourite thing in all the room. IT was always lovely to have a piping hot shower first thing in the morning| and late late at night. It invigorated the senses no end.Huge Shower and Bath| which again were of the highest standards| comfort and had a great water temperature.As for cleanliness| the room was routinely cleaned every day| fresh towels and bed sheets. Immaculate / Spotless are words that comes to mind here.We were both taken back by the friendliness of all staff| and cannot say enough about what lengths they go to| to ensure your happiness. Dean| our liaison officer (not sure if his official title)| was always courteous| friendly and always smiled| and took the time to speak to us| whenever he saw us. I cannot remember all the names of all the staff| but special mention to the guys who continuously brought me Beers and Cocktails to the beach| the Bar Staff at all the bars| especially those who introduced me to the Local Chamarel Vanilla Rum| and those who shown me where to buy it locally. The Crystal clear waters| and white sands are a joy to behold. The private beach ensures you are granted beds| loungers and a perfect spot in the sun| What better way to cool down| than in the warm Indian Ocean| and then a Beer waiting for you on your table after your dip. Be sure to head to the beach for sunset| treat yourself to a Cold Beer| or Rum Cocktail| then be amazed as the sun downs on the horizon. A view and image that will last with you a lifetime.The Hotel treated us to a Massage in the Clarins Spa| which by itself was amazing| and seriously relaxing. The Spa itself had all the facilities you would expect| but the Sauna and Steam Room are simply breath-taking in there size. My only real gripe| and this is a really small one| was the price for Food and Drink. They were a tad over priced in relation to the local bars and restaurant. I cannot recommend the Souvenir Bar and Restaurant immediately opposite the complex enough| with great local food. However| the food in the hotel was to a very high standard| although a little pricey.All in All| we would definitely go back| and the higher prices in no way should deter you from doing the same.As I mentioned| it was a little bit of paradise| luxury accommodation| and truly friendly people that made our stay as enjoyable as it was.,Manchester| United Kingdom,04-09-15,No,5
Honeymoon Bliss - A hotel experience above and beyond,We were originally going to book our Honeymoon through Kuoni and after several painful phone calls and emails with lack of knowledge of Mauritius and communication between the staff| not to mention receiving a quote with the incorrect date 3 times| we decided to look again.From searching on Google| we really liked that Beachcomber were Mauritius specialists. We gave them a call and the experience right from the start was completely different. The lady really took the time to understand what we wanted and she gave us some great advise.However| I did actually ignore her advice when she recommended we stay at Trou aux Biches in our second week; she explained it was so wonderful we might be disappointed going from there to another hotel. Stupidly| I ignored this and although Shandrani was nice| it didn't feel 'Honeymooney'. We decided to make the most of it and hired a car and toured around the South of the island but I didn't want to end our Honeymoon there so I emailed Beachcomber. Their customer service was unbelievable and within 3 hours we were back in the exceptional Trou aux Biches - and they didn't charge us a penny!So...what is it that makes Trou so perfect? Quite simply| everything! From the moment you are welcomed by the friendly reception staff you feel happy and special. Everything is luxurious but despite being top quality there was no hint of pretense. I loathe 'show off/glamour' hotels and although it's beautiful there was no false customer service by the staff or tacky decor - it's just pure relaxation run by staff who are passionate about what they do and clearly love the hotel and Mauritius. I've never been to a hotel where the resort manager walks around all of the restaurants every night to personally say hello to the guests and make sure everything was okay; she even knew our names when we returned. I've never experienced a hotel with this wonderful personal touch before.Both hotel rooms were wonderful and we had an outside shower which was lovely. The rooms were cleaned and towels changed twice a day. We were spoiled for choice with the restaurants - all 5 were incredible and top class. We weren't sure what to expect from the Italian as every other restaurant in the UK is Italian but this was our favourite..the buffet starter was delicious| the staff great and the setting being right on the beach was stunning. Our least favourite was The Deck (and the most expensive as we went for the Lobster which set us back about £60!) it was okay but not close to the others.We went for the Full Board Plus which is fantastic value but if you don't watch what you spend on drinks you'll get a nasty surprise on check-out (they're pretty pricey as you'd expect from any hotel in Mauritius).We chose this hotel because of the water sports and we were in water sport heaven. On our first morning we went for a 10am snorkel - sunny day| clear turquoise sea; what a way to start. We then found ourselves a spot on the stunning white sandy beach and spent the day napping then getting up to sail| paddle board| kayak or wake board - whatever you want is included. We loved that we could just get up and ask the boat staff to take us across to the wake board jetty in the middle of the sea and just spend a few hours wakeboarding. The staff were loads of fun and were more than happy to let us keeping having more goes and even go in the boat to watch each other and take photos.Do take a sunset walk along the beach right over to Mont Choisy - great atmosphere especially on a Sunday when all the locals come out to drink wine and play sport and catch up with families on the beach. We chose Mauritius over the Maldives because we wanted to explore and get a feel for the island and local life while having a bit of luxury and at Trou aux Biches we did exactly that and had the best of both worlds. Although now we've seen the whole island we will be quite content having a whole week just enjoying the hotel!I would like to thank Jackie and Emily for helping organise our dream honeymoon and Karen for organising our transfer and making sure we had no stress in doing so. You all went above and beyond and we've been recommending Beachcomber to everyone and will definitely be holidaying with you again.,Swindon| United Kingdom,30-08-15,Yes,5
Family holiday - average hotel - amazing beach experience,Last week my family and I visited the much lauded Troux aux Biches Resort and Spa in Mauritius. We stayed in a family suite for a week or so. Generally the hotel is very picturesque with the lions share of the amazing lagoon of crystal clear water with white tropical sand. The Hotel is really a true large resort experience. If you like big buffets with very average food this is your place. For us| not so much. A few negatives: the service across the board is poor at best. Long waits with what I can only assume are trainee waiters and cooking staff. English is not well understood and I would advise you to learn a few french words as service staff are generally not fluent|Several things were irritating: 1. despite our best efforts to call and reserve either the Thai or Indian or Italian restaurant we could not manage it except for a 10pm slot which was impossible with young children. 2. the hotel staff in general were slow and service was poor. especially waiter staff. 3. tea / coffee was always cold and really not great. 4. the hotel did not provide any creams only shower gels and shampoo / conditioner - for a five star hotel this is not on. 5. towels / sheets and bedding smelled off - to the extent I personally had to complain to get it fixed by the front office manager Belinda. I did also get an apology from the manager Fatima- but for this calibre and price of hotel... not on. 6. Laundry took 24hrs to arrive! For a five star hotel laundry should be delivered same day if delivered before 9am. 7. The food was really average - especially breakfast. If you have been ( like us to other hotels... this is simply bland and very average.) 7. I tried the spa - it was ok take it or leave it.On the positives| the hotel is situated very close to many fantastic spots in Grand Baie. Try them for dinner. The complimentary lunch offered till high season is really good and the narrowing of the food portfolio seems to do wonders. Less is more!!,Johannesburg| South Africa,28-08-15,Yes,3
PERFECT HOLIDAY,We stayed from 20th till 25th august with my two children aged 8 and 12 rooms 340 and 341.Everything was perfect from the day we stepped in till we checked out.The beach in front of the hotel is amazing very clean| the hotel offered a lot of activities for the children which keeps them busy.My daughter liked the kids club very much.The rooms were also great as we had a heated pool outside our rooms which we used to use till late.The food was great the staff very helpfull.Thankyou Trou aux Biches for making our holidays a memorable one.,Nairobi| Kenya,26-08-15,Yes,5
Perfect hotel on a perfect beach.,"I was slightly worried about booking this hotel due to some of the very negative reviews| but clearly the people did not actually go to this hotel. The staff were lovely| we didn't tip until the end of our holiday| but we're always remembered and made to feel special. The beach is pretty much near perfect| golden sand| stretching round a gorgeous bay. We had no problems booking a la carte restaurants| you just need to plan a couple of days in advance. Yes there are beach hawkers| but they soon go away if you tell them a polite ""no thank you"" and if you prefer you can have just as good a view from the loungers just behind the beach| but in the hotel grounds.We arrived after 3 nights in Dubai and the calm relaxed atmosphere could not have been a more welcome contrast!",Essex| United Kingdom,20-08-15,Yes,5
Great Stay I Mauritius,This is a first class resort suitable for families and couples alike. The resort is spacious| the rooms are excellent| food varied and of great quality. Staff were polite and helpful and Fatima proved extremely helpful when my father was taken ill during our stay. The sport facilities are top notch and we loved the available water sports. Highly recommendable,Hindhead| United Kingdom,20-08-15,Yes,4
Our Second Stay at this Fantastic Resort!,We are a family of four (teenage kids| 13 and 15) who have just returned from our second stay at this fabulous hotel. That says it all really.We were there for two weeks in August last year| and we booked it straight away for a return in 2015. We did not regret it. We love this place - it really is prefect in so many ways| and this seems to be borne out by the many reviews on here.I think this hotel must have one of the most serene reception areas of any hotel in the world. It is like walking into paradise after your hectic long haul flight. Instantly one feels relaxed and the staff immediately begin to take care of you and get you checked-in with no fuss.Once again| we were in two interconnecting beach-front suites. These are at ground level and each has its own little garden and a plunge pool. We had asked for the same suites as last year| and we were given them - 657 and 658. These are set back from the beach by some 100m which we prefer - you can get others which are much closer| but then you begin to lose a degree of privacy. Our teenagers shared one suite - the huge bigger-than king size bed had been made up into two twins (separate mattresses) and they were fine with that (they put a pillow wall between themselves!). The alternative is that one could have slept on the sofa bed instead.Both suites have wonderful en suite bathrooms and the most magnificent outdoor shower you have ever had. They also have baths if you are so inclined. The bedrooms are large and clean and have air con. Waking up each morning to the view of the Indian Ocean is pretty special.The food| as last year| was epic. Plenty of choice in the buffet restaurants| with different themes each night. Kids of all ages will be happy. There are also the special restaurants| which you need to book a few days in advance. We adore the Indian restaurant| and visited twice. We were on the full board plus package| which is all-inclusive| but only during the three meals| and with specific alcohol limits (eg one bottle wine with evening meal). If you want milk shakes and alcohol etc between meals| or after dinner| these you pay extra for - it just goes on your final bill at the end of your stay. It is not cheap!As ever| we were looked after by everyone and made to feel very welcome. It was wonderful that quite a few of the staff remembered us from last year. Everyone was just amazing. Special mention has to go to Menon in La Caravelle who looked after us so well at breakfast time| and also to Kavita in L’Oasis bar who not only remembered us from last year| but who was especially friendly and helpful whenever we ate.As a returning table tennis champion from last year (and apparently one of the top 5 players ever to visit the hotel!)| I was very warmly welcomed by Jim and Andy| the resident sports staff. Both of them are excellent table tennis players| super friendly people| and all-round great guys| and we had a lot of fun again| trying to beat each other. They are wonderful with the kids| and Jim in particular is a great table tennis coach - I asked him to give my son some coaching. Unfortunately my family was struck down with illness during our stay. Three of us got a tummy bug| which is just one of those things really when you come to a tropical island. I was deeply impressed with the degree of concern and care shown by Fatima| a senior manager of the hotel - she was constantly checking how we were| personally| and was arranging for complimentary deliveries of yoghurt and drinks and whatever else we felt able to eat/drink| while we recovered. I have nothing but praise for her / the hotel on this| and am very grateful. We lost about 5 days all in all due to this illness| which is a tremendous shame.A word of warning - don’t touch the submerged rope that lies just off the beach| protecting swimmers from boats. I did| and the consequences were not great. It turns out there are tiny jellyfish living on the seaweed on the rope. I got stung across a large part of my arm| and ended up with a huge burn / blister and horrible welts. I needed a doctor eventually for antibiotics| creams| painkillers| steroids....... I was in a lot of pain for almost a week. Hey ho. Please be careful.Shore shoes are best - bits of coral and rock make it sharp under foot when standing in the sea. The sea is warm enough to swim without wetsuits| even though it is winter there. It is very safe and you don’t need to worry about nasty marine life (just avoid the rope). Go snorkelling via the hotel boat house - it really is superb| and ideal for beginners too. There is a wonderful main swimming pool at the hotel| and also a series of smaller swimming pools set well back from the beach| behind the beach front suites.The beach hawkers are only a pain if you let them be a pain. If they smell a sale| they will be all over you. A firm ‘no thanks’ is enough to give you the peace you want. August is winter on Mauritius. Last August the weather was perfect every day| being mid twenties and yet still a fierce sun. This year| the weather in our first week was variable| with two very wet days| and several days of high wind and showers. I am told this is very unusual. Nevertheless| it was warm if not hot| and we comforted ourselves in the knowledge that the weather on this part of the island (north west) is the best on the island at this time of year.Will we go back for a third visit? Almost certainly. We love Trou aux Biches and I am certain we will return at some point in the next few years. Highly recommended.,Leicester| United Kingdom,16-08-15,Yes,5
Beautiful hotel but disappointing in many things,I didn't know if I should rate it as 3 or 4| but according to what I expect from a 5-star hotel| I decided to rate it as a 3| because I have seen many things I didn't liked for the price I paid| and doesn't fit with the 5-star hotels I've been before. First I will start with the strong points:- The hotel is beautiful| modern but at the same time with a lot of wood that makes it more cute.- The beach of Trou Aux Biches is very pretty. It has to be said that is not private for the hotel| but I do not care about that| on the contrary. - Many included activities such as wind surf| paddle surf| snorkeling... For children... But hey! You have to book some of them a week in advance!!- The location is good if you would like to be at the beach all day| enjoying the hotel activities (as in August the East side is more windy). But if you like to do some cultural and outdoor activities (trekking| etc.)| the location is not that good as the north of the island is more devoted to tourists. Nearly all excursions (cultural as chamarel| trekking at natural parks| etc...) are in the south!! - Some staff is friendly and helps you staying comfortable (not all have to say).Now| here it comes the weak points:- Rooms are clean but maintenance could be improved. The wood floor of our shower was quite broken.- In the beach there are few loungers| and guests book them in the morning (and leave wherever they want leaving only the towel to keep it booked) and there is no possibility to get any afterwards. No staff is controlling that. - The food in the buffet is average| don't think is worthy to pay for lunch and dinner at the hotel| because it is too expensive for what is offered. If you want to eat in another restaurant inside the hotel (they have a french| Italian| indian| thai and fish restaurant)| not all dishes are included in the pack of full pension. On the other hand| we are not sure about the restaurants offer outside the hotel| but the town of Trou Aux Biches is quite close.- Although we had all dishes included| they wanted us to pay for a breakfast box one day we had to leave early for an excursion. Fortunately there were people leaving to the airport that morning and they left a soft buffet of fruit and croissants. First time in my life that I have breakfast included and they wanted me to pay for a simple breakfast box. - No courtesy water in the room| except the first day (all 5-star hotel that I have been| leaves you a courtesy water every morning). It is not a very weak point but water is quite expensive (100Rs)| more than petrol.- The quality of the Wi-fi is pretty poor| although it is free.- The behavior changes depending on appearances. If you are an old couple or family| which seems to have money| you will receive more attention than if you are a young couple; even if you are paying the same. One example would be the director of the hotel| that came some nights at the restaurants asking guests about their stay. She passed nearby us| many times| without asking. We are a couple above the 30s| even we seem to be younger. Nevertheless| it was rude. - Staff at the buffet restaurant are quite unfriendly| as well as in the fish restaurant (the deck). Sometimes even rude. It differs from the staff at the thai and indian restaurants| who are much more friendly.- Even though the hotel had many Spanish guests| like us| they only had printed news from Britain| France| Italy and Germany (the last day I saw for China or Japan| cannot distinguish). I asked many times for news in Spain but never did the effort of printing them. They said| sorry but we haven't. No intention to change it. - And last but not least| something I felt very disappointed| is the hostility in front of guests. For example| before leaving the room for the check out| the minibar responsible comes to your room and locks the minibar with a bridle!! Seriously? I've paid a lot of money for 11 nights in this hotel| and you think I am interested in stealing a coke? First time I've seen it too. Another example| we entered into the hotel shop| to buy some souvenirs| but one of the staff started following us through the shop without taking and eye from us and without asking what were we searching for. I felt so violent that I left the shop and bought all souvenirs outside (in a shop in chamarel| people selling at the beach| etc). Another example would be a waiter running after us asking if we had signed the bill of one water and a beer. Hey| can you check first? Of course I have signed it. Why this distrust?In summary| I am very disappointed. For many years I've been traveling| and I have seen better 4-star hotels than this 5-star. I would not come back in this hotel.Ah! And regarding the diving center inside the hotel| i have to say that even they are quite disorganized| the staff is very friendly and helpful; and the dives were good. Be careful they full the tank completely! Because once I dived below 200 atm. But| if you want to see shark and/or dolphins| at least in August (their winter time)| you should again go to the south. Here you can see moray eels| a lot of tropical fish| turtles| etc. But no big fish. Nevertheless| the experience was pretty good.,Liverpool| United Kingdom,16-08-15,Yes,3
3-Bedroom Villa,"You get what's you paid for! In the Villa you pay for the best and that is what you get - bedrooms| bathrooms| private pool| deck area (and with all due respect| the photographs/video's do not do the Villa justice!) and best of all a brilliant valet/butler - in our case Baurun (""Bo"") - all of the highest quality and with beautiful beaches and a choice of 6 EXCELLENT restaurants (wonderful tastes and choices) this was the best family holiday we could ever have wished for. Villa guests are treated so well you will never want to go home; the staff could never be more accommodating or helpful (and they enjoy being at TAB they stay for many years) - Bo was the greatest valet one could hope for (25 years); Nilesh was a wonderful supervisor who checked on us constantly| making sure we had everything we needed; Nobin the same who ran around something silly to ensure our stay went perfectly; Margaret in the spa and her wonderful smile; Prateeyma (20+ years) was a wonderful Villa manager for whom nothing was too big or small a request to make this memorable and special mention to Vijay (our BMW X5 Limousine chauffeur) who drove us and looked after us all day - a brilliant source of stories and advice when shopping or looking around Mauritius (33 years) and once again Bo who made sure we had the laziest holiday one could have!!!This was a return to the Hotel for our 20th Wedding Anniversary (this time with two sons) and we believed our first visit was memorable and never to be repeated but this time everything has been surpassed and we will return again. As you can see| TAB is excellent in all areas| and the Villa's make it perfect",Liverpool| United Kingdom,15-08-15,Yes,5
Simply Stunning Resort,I am writing from the departure lounge after a wonderful family holiday and this gorgeous resort. From the welcome when we arrived to our departure this afternoon the staff were attentive and made us feel so welcome. A special thank you to both Fatima and Jerome who really went out of their way to make sure our stay was a memorable one. This is an all suite hotel and the rooms were very spacious with huge bathrooms. There are 6 restaurants and the Indian was our favourite. The hotel was full during our visit but there were always sun beds available when we arrived at the beach (we are NOT early risers!). We opted for the all-inclusive (it's called Escape Package). They don't really get the concept of all inclusive and therefore you could find yourself paying extra for things like pancakes in the afternoon or snacks and alcoholic drinks from your mini bar.I think they need to tweak the all inclusive situation as it can cause you to feel a bit ripped off after paying a lot of money for the privilege! Nonetheless it does not detract this from being one of the best hotels we have stayed in... Ever! Thank you Trou aux Biches!,St. Albans| United Kingdom,13-08-15,Yes,5
Excellent Everything!!,"We spent our honeymoon at the hotel and the experience was far beyond anything we could have imagined! All the staff| from waiters to porters to chefs to management and everyone in between were top class! Photos do not quite do the hotel justice and we were constantly overwhelmed by the beauty of the resort| beaches and surroundings. The food was amazing whether it was in one of the a la carte or buffet restaurants.Our room was a tropical suite and was superb! We did not have a view of the ocean| but this was actually better as you do not have passers-by peering into your room. Also| the 50m walk to the beach was not exactly tiresome.My wife and I could not get used to the fact that places like this exist. If there are resorts like this is the world| why does anyone live anywhere else??Unfortunately| we were only able to stay for 7 days| but it was by far the best holiday we have ever been on! We will definitely be making a return trip in the near future and this time we wont waste too much time looking for the ""right"" hotel.... the Beachcomber Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa is our first choice destination - hopefully next time we will have a few more days to enjoy the life of luxury!",Johannesburg| South Africa,13-08-15,Yes,5
best choice for honeymooners,I think this is the best hotel you will find on the entire island!Beaches was fantastic| staff was amazing og the Food was just WOOOOW!This hotel is for the persons who wants to just stay the Whole trip at a hotel where they have everything.They had all fasilities| alot of swimming pools| a veery long Beach With the best Beach on the Whole island| outdoor activities| such as tennis and badminton. A spa with great outdoor massage. Last but not least 6 restaurant to Choice from.Since we where there on our honeymoon| we got free Upgrade| free lunsj| gift and massage for free.I will definetly og back to this hotel.,Oslo| Norway,11-08-15,Yes,5
Best holiday ever!!!!,This slice of paradise was the most relaxing and luxurious holiday we have ever been on. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left the staff were incredible. Nothing we asked for was too much trouble and we were even provided with a three course complementary lunch at Le Deck and a room on our last day| due to our late flight. The Room - senior beachfront suite 348 was amazing and massive! It was in the middle so was not noisy at night and easy walking distance to all amenities. The deck was also nice and sunny and in front the beach was quiet and perfect. The bed was big and comfy and our little boy was given a nice cot. The mini bar has some lovely wines in - we mainly drank the French Rose - which is delicious and nice and dry.The Restaurants - wow!!! All of them are fantastic| including the buffet ones. The service is brilliant in all of them. Favourite food was at La Caravelle| Le Deck and L'Oasis for me| but my husband loved the Indian and Thai. The Italian was ok too. I would strongly recommend being full board plus as you will get a bottle of wine with dinner ( good wine) and a bottle of water. At lunch you get a glass of wine or beer and a bottle of water. This was worth it for us as wine starts at about £22 a bottle. My little boy had some fantastic food here and they had a child's menu in all of the restaurants. We were also made to feel welcome in all of them and in the Thai my son was made a little Thai meal.The breakfast was fab each day and I really don't know why anyone would moan about either of the buffets... I would have been happy with it for two weeks. Just for info - you can email to pre book restaurants a week before| which I would recommend. They also do theme nights which were great and I would recommend attending the Surf and Turf night ( although it is extra) it is definitely worth it!!!The facilities- wow! A million swimming pools and gorgeous beach. Ignore comments about the beach sellers - just don't get into a conversation if you don't want anything- I just said 'no thanks' and then no one bothered me. The kids club looked great - but our little boy was a tad young| but the staff that ran it were clearly brilliant as you would see them taking the kids to do water sports| swimming| to the entertainment and to the restaurants. The water sports are free and we took out a pedalo a few times and a hobbycat. We had a fantastic babysitter for a couple of nights too - which was very reasonable.The staff - the staff attitudes were fantastic| nothing was too much trouble and they would pre empt your needs without you asking. The room service guy| our maid - along with restaurant staff were brilliant. This is what really made our holiday to be honest. Staff genuinely want to check and ensure that you are having a perfect holiday and if even the tiniest thing bothers you they will sort it out straight away. Jerome and Fatima were also wonderful and made sure that our last day was still a holiday by ensuring we had a room to stay in after check out and we enjoyed a complimentary creole lunch at Le Deck which was delicious. We really want to go back here - the service is second to none. On our last day we were given a garden suite - which we also would have been very happy with as the pool in the middle that is shared is mostly empty. Thanks again Trou aux Biches - family Turnnidge,England,09-08-15,Yes,5
Excellent hotel and location!!,Just returned from 2 week holiday here. Almost didn't choose Mauritius as we were concerned if the weather would be good enough as it is winter in July. Arrived in pouring rain in the south but by the time we were at Trou aux Biche the sun was out. We had one full day of rain in two weeks (which is unusual). It rains often over night and occasional shower on some days but brightens up and is sunny/some intermittent cloud but still warm. We found the temperature was perfect as not too hot if you want to play tennis or be more active on the island. Hotel - amazing truly 5 star. Staff very friendly and efficient. Best welcome we have ever received at a hotel. We were in a villa and they went all out on making us feel welcome and showing us around. Also if you are in villa you get it all day on check out day. Great when we had a late night flight - gives you an extra day of holiday. This is all you need to know really but done detailed review if you want to read more. Food - never had a bad meal. L'Oasis is the buffet open for breakfast lunch and dinner. Do the Mauritian night and the Asian night. So much to choose from at all times for lunch and dinner - fish| chicken| lamb| beef| curries| breads| pasta| pizza| fries| rice| salads (so many to choose from)| soup| potato wedges. Great to get the kids eating something different we banned pizza and chips sometimes and they loved the fish and meat dishes. If they don't like it go back for something else. Buffet is unlimited trips. However| leave room for dessert(s). Fresh fruit - watermelon| passion fruit| mango| guava| bananas| pineapple (local best ever| can eat the core it is so soft and fresh). Yoghurts| ice creams| sorbets| then the cakes - lots to choose from but nice small sensible pieces| creme caramel| fruit pies. Breakfasts at L'Oasis or Caravelle - again buffet style with unlimited tea| coffee or hot chocolate served by staff. Juices| cooked breakfast| crepe| waffles| pain au chocolat| fresh fruit| toast and jams| breads| pastries. A la carte restaurants - book a few days in advance| tried them all. All very good. Just be aware some items on menu are extra but this is clear and when we ordered some they re- confirm with you that it is a supplement item. Beach - we used beach shoes in water to swim as broken coral and a few rocky patches. Did not see any sea urchins on beach but see loads when out snorkelling/diving. But lots of people bare foot. Not needed for walking on beach though. Water still warm enough for swimming snorkelling in winter. Decent snorkelling - go on trip from boathouse. Activities - go to the boathouse for free activities and trips. Do not buy from the hawkers on the beach if the boathouse offers it. Learn to water ski for free. We met several people who had learned in a couple of days and said the teaching for the kids was great start on a pole at side of boat and then progress to line from boat on a fixed board if necessary. We did dolphin trip. You get the boat to yourself but it takes up to 13 so find some friends and split the cost is an option. Catamarans go too for cheaper but these are massive and we witnessed them sailing into the pod of dolphins risking hitting them. Boathouse guys get you close enough for great photos and then its up to you to get in and swim with them if you want too. Huge pod very playful. Also saw a whale with baby on way too which we observed from safe distance but could still see clearly. Glass bottom boat and snorkelling trips good - they go to the other side of the reef. Dive centre - great guys. Look after you very well. Did 2 dives (we are not qualified) kids loved it. Need to be 10 years old. (Any younger and often ears won't equalise). Met qualified family divers who always do dive holidays and they thought this was very good. Not the colourful corals of a barrier reef or caribbean but lots of fish moray eels etc and at greater depths turtles. Sport centre and gym. First class gym| table tennis| badminton| pétanque pitch. 6 excellent tennis courts - free racquet hire but need to buy balls. Book your time early on the day - they get busy. Throughout the resort all staff speak excellent English but practice your school french as it is appreciated and you'll get some free french lessons and pronunciation advice too if you want!!Beach sellers - they are constant - selling jewellery and clothing. But they are polite and get the message quickly if you are not interested. Others are trip sellers - catamarans| parasailing and tube/inflatable rides and waterskiing. Again not pushy with selling but constant. It is a public beach after all. Also 5 min walk down beach to town where ATM available| convenience store and souvenir shops who will give you a good price on marked items (ie 15% off).Car hire - easy and cheap through Hertz at hotel. Avoid driving through Port Louis if you can - heavy traffic. New motorway open mon- fri avoids it and stunning scenery wherever you go. If (when!) you get lost ask a local - very friendly people. We are not people to do a resort twice but this is the exception that breaks the rule - we will definitely go back. Wonderful country| resort and people. Just wish there were still dodos here !!!,Amersham| United Kingdom,03-08-15,Yes,5
Relaxing and worthy choice in Mauritius,We spent four night at Beachcomber Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa| as honeymooners| and we enjoyed a lot. The first room we were (127) was terribly noisy since it is close to the main road. We asked to change the room| and after 16 hours they accomplished to do that. The reception staff was helpful but definitely not friendly at all. Conversely the restaurants staff were very kind!The second room (415) where we moved in was in a central crescent| more secluded| totally silent and quite and we finally enjoyed the beach and the several water activities.The complimentary treatment at Clarins Spa was exclusive and extremely pleasant| what gift for our honeymoon.We tried basically each of the 6 restaurants| that offer a great variety in international and local dishes| but they is not worth the price (50 Eur per person| excluded drinks| is a shame).,Parma| Italy,30-07-15,Yes,4
Fabulous family vacation on Mauritius - Troux aux Biche,"We are a family of 4| 2 adults| 2 children| 12 and 10. Have been at Trou aux Biches resort for 18 days in 07.2015. Have chosen the location based on deep net research and based on feedback from our travel agent. We are very carefully selecting our vacation targets since time cannot be given back.Exec summary: The resort completely matched our expectations. It is carefully managed and a great location to relax if you decide for Mauritius.Reception:After 15 hours travelling we drove ca 1 hour from airport to resort. We were very excited with respect to standard based on what we saw from the car. When we reached the resort its like diving into a world of well maintained luxury with a warm welcome.Booked two superior suites on one floor| second level: Why? --> great privacy for us| meanwhile the children were close - we felt safe at all times. The suites are ca 70 sqm| have a separate bath room and a separated toilet.We booked half board - and were offered a free of charge ""light lunch"" - which is understated - it's a complete buffet offering everything from fish| meat| pasta| pizza| salad| bread +++ There are 6 restaurants in the resort| which i will name in sequence of OUR preference| top down.1) Il Corallo| Italian: Fantastic service. Fantastic food. The only restaurant with a great wine ""cellar"" - The chief of restaurant knows how to run his team.2) Le Deck: Sea Food: Majority of a la carte included in half board. Lobster costed 2700 rupies - well worthe the money. Our kids prefer pasta which was organized instantly. Would like to thank SUNNY and HANS - you guys are great to anticipate customer wishes - excellent.3) La Caravelle - International. - they share the live music with the Italian restaurant. Great food. Our prime location for breakfast.4) L'Oasis: the main buffet based restaurant: Great service.90% of the staff super friendly and conscious to serve. Recommendation: Go there when the Mauritian evening is rigged: for us this was on tuesdays.5) Mahiya: Indian: Great view into kitchen. Service ok. 6) Blue Ginger| Thai: we were a little disappointed and ate here only once. The location was too windy for us and we were freezing.Management: Ricardo is in charge of the Corallo and Caravelle. He knows how to run his team. Fatima| second chief in charge knows how to be close to customers in a decent way| focusing on that we experienced great value for money.Sport facilities:Water skiing| Glass bottom boat excursion| loaning a CAT| windsurfing including lessons are all free of charge and managed by the guys in the boat house.The people there are GREAT. We would love to thanks JEAN CLAUDE for being passionate and a great teacher for water skiing - CANDY for teaching our children in windsurfing. You guys are so positive and passionate in your jobs and made our experience a great one.Beach:Beaches| as i understood| are public on Mauritius. The beach is ok| falls off compared to Maledives but is better than Spain. There are several guys selling boating services in a ""passive way"". OK.Personnally i was not fond of people selling t-shirts and other stuff - they were far too pushy and steadily trying to sell. Even considered to pay them for giving us peace... - but as mentioned - beaches i perceived as public and this is maybe outside the reach of what the hotel management has influence on.Excursions:We did a 1 day tour to a ""safari park"" Casela. What we liked best: There are a couple of ZIP lines which are really great. - Before you can enjoy them you have to walk a shaky expansion bridge - really cool! Yes we did it....14.000 rupies including transfer.We have been out with a speedboat to watch dolphins. Great tour. Enjoyed it.We have been out on deep see fishing. 12 Thousand rupies. Would do it again.1/2 day is enough. Season for Marlin| which is on my bucket list| is February though. We caught a 1|3 m Dorade. What surprised us| different to Maledives| is that the catch belongs to the boat...so no eating of caught fish for us....Again: this was a tour outside the hotels offers...All in all: A great experience. From what we have seen from Mauritius on of the best beaches. Location on the west helps that its not too windy - don't forget a pull over for the evenings as temperate drops to maybe 20 degrees C in the evening.We can warmly recommend a stay in Beachcomber Trou aux Biches and would love to return in a couple of years - maybe in February to catch a Marlin...(-:",Oslo| Norway,29-07-15,Yes,5
The place you've always dreamed of...,Words fail me. This is everything you never dreamed of| because whatever you thought you wanted| this is better. Amazing rooms| great food| perfect location| top service| facilities for whatever you want| and much more. Imagine stepping out of your room| straight into your own plunge pool| walking along the beachfront to breakfast| eating the perfect breakfast| and all whilst being treated like royalty. And each day seems to get better. If there is class above first class| this place is it. I personally love the outdoor shower - the best shower I've ever known!,London,29-07-15,Yes,5
Amazing - can't fault it!,We have just returned (July 2015) and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we had a fantastic experience. SERVICEThe service from ALL the staff was exceptional. Fatima (head of the resort) greeted us when we arrived (10:30pm) and we saw her most days - always with a huge smile and checking to see if our stay was good. James| Kevin and Bertie in the dive centre were fantastic as were the guys at the boat-house for all the other water-sports on offer.Overall| the whole resort excelled itself with exceptional service. Can't fault it.ROOMWe stayed in a family suite in block 500 (ground floor) which was great. Room was very well layed out with two rooms being private enough for a family. The outdoor shower was wonderful! The room was cleaned every day and sheets changed more than enough times. Fresh beach towels daily. Our dedicated room 'houseboy' was great and couldn't have done more to make our stay really comfortable.Being on the ground floor was good because we could walk straight from our terrace into the nearby pool. Although this is a big hotel| because all villas are grouped into small blocks it doesn't feel like you're surrounded by lots of people. Having been round the whole hotel if (when?!) we go again we'd probably choose the beach-front villas in block 100. The pool in block 300 is warmer than all the others (we swam in them all!) so if you've got children| that block is a good choice. While we were there we also looked around a pool villa which if you're taking a larger group (maybe grandparents too) is a great choice. Really private and you get your own butler who will cook a BBQ for you included in the price.FACILITIESWe made full use of all the water-sports included in our package - all excellent. Also tennis (great courts!) and the spa (wonderful). In the evenings there is usually a live band in the main bar and also local dancers who put on a show. All fantastic.For those with younger children (our youngest is 8) the Bob Marlin kids club looks great. We didn't use it that much (our 8 year old prefers to stay with her 15 & 16 year-old sisters) but did make use of the water-skiing facilities for youngsters - and said that was the best part of her holiday!FOODIn general the food was excellent. We were on the full-board plus package so almost everything was included and we'd recommend that. Our children particularly loved the L'Oasis and La Caravelle as they are buffet-style and gave them lots of options to choose from. It's advisable to book the a-la-carte restaurants in advance since they get booked-up. Sounds tedious| but worth doing. They were all excellent quality although the a-la-carte restaurants don't change their menus so just be aware of that.There are some tropical birds that fly around the restaurants but they really don't cause a problem and we didn't see any signs of any bird 'poop' at all.BEACHThe beach is fantastic and gets raked / swept every morning!! The sand is like icing sugar although there are also bits of sharp coral in places. Having said that| no need for jelly shoes| we were bare-footed all week.There are beach hawkers so expect to be sold to. However| nearly all of them are very friendly and we got to know a few quite well. Of particular mention are Delboy| Maurice and Robin who were all lovely and became friends who gave local tips and were always happy to say hello. Of course| we made some nice purchases too!WEATHERWe were a little worried about the weather in winter. We had rain almost every day but it only lasted in short bursts and was followed by full-on bright| strong sunshine and blue skies. We met a couple who'd spent a few days in the south part of the island and hadn't seen any sunshine in 4 days. At this time of year| the north west is the best option as it is more sheltered (can get really windy in the south / east) and sees more sunshine.Would we go again at this time of year? Yes.SUMMARYCan't fault it. We'd love to stay there again. Would we recommend this hotel? Absolutely!,Bath| United Kingdom,25-07-15,Yes,5
Fantastic Hotel Experience,My girlfriend and I spent 10 days at Trou Aux Biches and had an amazing time. We are used to staying in nice hotels all over sand this place is right up there. We had full board plus and were delighted with the food options (6 restaurants). The food was delicious| service fantastic and the menu changed whilst we were though so eating in the same place again was not a problem. The wines included were also perfectly good.We stayed in the 'basic' room which was still excellent and very large with a balcony. The bed was comfortable and facilities excellent. We stayed in room 148 which had one of the communal pools outside. The pool is beautiful and provides a nice change to the sand and it was very quiet and relaxing. The beach itself was beautiful and many people we met said it was the nicest on the island. It's huge| has great sand and has plenty of sun loungers.The hotel has free pedals| sailing| wake boarding etc which is great. The gym facilities are also excellent with the very small downside the lack of an olympic bar and bumper plates. We tried the spa and loved that too -pricey but what do you expect for the Indian Ocean.All in all we loved it. The place is spotless| has lots of staff who are incredibly friendly which makes the level of service top quality. They even have quality departure rooms if you are checking out late as we did. The hotel isn't cheap but in our view worth every penny and we will definitely return. The only downside we could add would be the entertainment at Oasis bar was sometimes dodgy quality but that is nit picking. The pianists and singers at Karavelle bar for example were fantastic.We would highly recommend this hotel.One other note: we did a 1 day wild dolphin and whale tour. We swam with loads of wild dolphins and saw a large pod of sperm whale up close. It was through Dolswim and was definitely worth the money.,London,23-07-15,Yes,5
Perfect Family Holiday,From the minute you arrive in the lobby of the resort| two things become evident: (1) it is absolutely first class; and (2) the staff are genuinely fantastic people. Room was spacious and had everything we needed. Restaurants were all very good. In particular| I would recommend eating outside near the beach front at the seafood restaurant or the Indian restaurant. The best thing about the hotel| are the pools. They are huge| and therefore never seemed to get crowded. Ultimate 5 star experience! So happy we chose this hotel. Stunning property with a creative layout. It's ideal for a family holiday (plenty of activities for kids & teens) or a romantic getaway. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and Trou Aux Biches will be memorable. We will definitely return!!! Highly recommend this hotel.,Perth| Australia,22-07-15,Yes,5
Difficult two weeks made easy,Spent 2 weeks at Trou Aux Biche| unfortunately my son was quite sick for the first week. That's where having a fantastic room and location really helps. We had the senior beach front suite number 108 and its size and location were perfect.My perspective on the resort| positives first| very friendly staff| clean well set out suite with great indoor and outdoor showers| own swimming pool great for after swimming at the beach. Truly stunning gardens. Birds everywhere and generally a good location on the island.Negatives| and there will always be some however I still give the resort top marks overall. Bed was hard as a rock for us. Laundry| not for the feint hearted | check the prices before you send it off. Food was really good in most restaurants at the resort although they are variable| I think the Thai is the weakest one and the Deck and Oasis are the best.If you go| be prepared to spend but to be well looked after for your money.,Perth| Australia,19-07-15,Yes,5
Mixed feelings,Just returned from 4nights at Trou aux Biche| and must say I had some mixed feelings about the hotel on leaving.Check-in was good and the staff are all very friendly. I arrived on an early morning flight and although my room was not ready at 9am (check-in is 2pm)| I was given a transit room where I could go shower and freshen up. The restaurants and bar were open to use straight away. At 2pm i could check into my room.The rooms are large| bathrooms huge| and the hotel grounds beautiful. One really cannot find fault there. I had a problem with the loo where the previous guest must have accidentally damaged the flush mechanism| but maintenance was quick to come and fix the problem.Only critique is that the hotel should think about spraying regularly for mosquitoes| like many of the other Mauritian hotels do once per week. Possibly they do| and it was just not whilst I was there. Mosquitoes around the garden rooms are a problem and if you one of the unlucky people whose blood they like then you get stung often. As mentioned the hotel staff are always friendly and will always try help in whatever way they can to make your stay a pleasurable experience.The beach is nice| long white sands| and swimming in the sea is possible. In peak June-July season when we were there| and despite it being winter| it does however get very busy. My impressions was that the hotel was full| and one quickly lands up on the beach with people simply positioning themselves on the sand right next to your sunshade. If you turn your back or go to your room for whatever reason - consider your deckchairs and sunshade gone....[fair enough]My biggest gripe was probably the food. We were on an All-inclusive package and the food simply is not 5* standard. Drinks and cocktails are great and can't be faulted| but the food selection and preparation is simply not worthy of a 5* hotel.Breakfasts are ok| and you can expect what you can get in most 4/5* western hotels.But the reason i can say the balance of dining was disappointing is because I stayed at the Shandrani 2weeks before| and have stayed at LeVictoria (4*+) a year ago. I think where the problem comes in is that Trou aux Biche is typically not an All-inclusive and when they package this option the hotel falls short. They certainly don't live up to what the Shandrani offers| and my feeling was they even fall horribly short of LeVictoria. I dinned at the Trou Biche buffet restaurant| both the International and the Italian restaurant| and not one impressed me in any way. The dish selection was limited and the food bland. There's simply no reason for this| and if you go to LeVictoria you would see why. At LeVictoria I enjoyed some of the best meals I've eaten in Mauritius| and having stayed at most of the Beachcomber hotels already| i think this was the most disappointing in terms of food and restaurant quality. If I had been staying there on an ala carte basis paying the prices that Trou aux Biche charges on its menus| I would have been really unimpressed.Its a pity because the hotel is really nice| but the dining experience is a let down. I left with the feeling that Beachcomber tries to fill the hotel in the winter season with an All-inclusive offering to keep occupancy up| but its simply not up too scratch.certainly not for a 5* hotel. Rather then go to LeVictoria - your room might be smaller| but your overall experience will be better.,Johannesburg| South Africa,17-07-15,No,4
Excellent choice - you will adore it,Families & couples will love it. 5 restaurants| private swimming pools| lots of water activities (without extra charge) - kayaks| glass bottom boat| skintifique and others| tennis| pool| badminton| volleyball| yoga| gym. You will have your private outdoor tropical shower in your bathroom. Welcoming stuff. Towel change and room service twice a day (or more if you need). And you will never feel too crowdy there. I guess the best choice in Mauritius.,London| United Kingdom,16-07-15,No,5
Heaven in every way!,The hotel is just fantastic. The whole arsenal is set into a giant tropical garden which truly makes you feel secluded| especially since all buildings are lower than the surrounding palm trees and vegetation. The main pool is really big and looks great with little islands with palm trees. The pool also offers a breathtaking view of the beach and the sea. Besides the main pool there are smaller pools between the bungalows which are very nice and secluded. The are heated and you can have a nice romantic swim there at night. The beach looks fantastic with its white sand and the bright blue and crystal clear water. Only downside is the limited space to swim due to the many boats on the beach which offer all sorts of water action. The hotels' own water sports center offers a wide selection of stuff to do like snorkelling| glass bottom boat trips| waterski| wakeboard| stand-up paddling and single and double canoes.The six different restaurants are all great and only one offers a buffet for dinner| while the rest is á la carte or with a menu depending on your package. For breakfast and lunch I would definitely recommend the La Caravelle because of its breathtaking view of the sea. Also at night the bar at the La Caravelle is more upscale and usually offers better live music. The L'Oasis restaurant at the main pool is more family orientated and only offers a buffet. The L'Oasis bar offers the same drinks than the La Carevelle bar and especially Benito is a fantastic bar keeper who is always willing to offer you an extra surprise cocktail according to your taste. The music and show programme at the L'Oasis bar is more main stream and feels a bit like the animation programme of an vacation club. Also the interior design of the L'Oasis is less sophisticated. The Indian and Thai restaurant are both smaller and near the reception. Both offer a fixed menu| which changes during the week. The food and the ambience in both are exquisite. The service in all of the different restaurants is always perfect and the staff are really keen on making your every wish come true. Once a week they also a Surf & Turf buffet on the beach which also fantastic and very romantic. The rooms are really spacious. We first had a tropical garden suite with an outdoor shower and a terrace. We changed into a upstairs junior suite| which was less visible accessible from the outside. The only thing I would recommend to change in the rooms| would be to have a carpeted area and to replace the rather cheap looking easy chairs with a comfortable and cosy couch. Maybe also include an in-house media system| because the TV programme is rather lame. The wifi is rather slow but you are still able to check mail and download some stuff. There is no wifi at the pool or the beach| which is good because you are finally able to leave your phone| tablet or computer in the room and relax!The hotel really complies to its 5+ stars standard and I can highly recommend it.,Bayreuth| Germany,15-07-15,Yes,5
Heaven on earth,One of the most wonderful places on this planet . This is really heaven | the stuff never hesitate to give you a perfect stay. It was Our 5.th visit to this amazing hotel and we will allways come back. The service provided by Fatima was terrific. Thank you so much,Milan| Italy,14-07-15,Yes,5
Amazing resort!,We just came back from a perfect holiday| me | my husband and our little princess. TAB is just the perfect place to spend your holiday if you want to feel that you are in paradise. Everything was perfect| very spacious rooms| the gardens are so beautiful and the place is incredible clean| well maintained and managed by a wonderful staff. The Manager of the resort| Ms. Fatima is lovely and taking care so well that all the need of the guest are well satisfied. We booked a trip with one agency outside of the resort which seems to not be serious. Ms. Fatima managed to get our money back without having any headache even was not the resort problem. i am living in Dubai and most of the services are great in the 5 stars resort but you feel that are nice because they need to be nice. At Trou Aux Biches everyone was so polite| so nice with the kids| so helpful but from all their heart.I am not even talking about the SPA which is probably one of the most beautiful SPA I have seen in my life and the Kids Club which is the equivalent of a 5* Hotel for kids. We enjoyed many of the amenities and came back very relaxed and happy. There are a lot of activities planned daily and many of them are free| which is also amazing (wakeboard| kayak| snorkeling| etc.). The sport center is also very modern.The resort is huge and is divided in a lot of areas with small pools if you don't want to go to the main pool..The beach is so clean and perfect.I can only highly recomment this resort and we will be back for sure!,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,13-07-15,Yes,5
A Week of Bliss,"Oh my gosh ! What a week away. From the sea facing room with a private pool to an outdoor tropical shower plus amazing food and service| my hubby| son & I were treated like we were the only guests in an almost full hotel. The restaurants were fabulous and so spoilt for choice but the Indian restaurant| Mahiya| deserves a special mention. The food melts in your mouth and is so moreish. Plus chef Satish and his team both in the kitchen and front of house are so friendly| you will want a second visit.There are pools everywhere on the property if the ocean isn't your thing. But the water is calm so you can also make use of the hotel's rowing boats| stand up paddle boards or even water ski.I have to say a word about the staff at this hotel. Nothing and I mean nothing| is too much trouble for them| from the amazing gentleman| Kevin who tidied our room everyday to the F&B Manager| Jerome and to Fatima| the hotel's executive manager. Everyday they welcomed us with a smile and a ""bonjour| ca va?"" that we honestly felt like we were the only guests in the hotel.Would I go back with my family ? A resounding yes !",Cape Town| South Africa,13-07-15,Yes,5
Return trip and still love it| but...,We returned to this hotel exactly a year later because for the first time we have found a hotel in Mauritius that works for us on multiple levels. The beach is beautiful and long making for some great walks| and the water is clear and deep| even at low tide which is unusual for many beaches in Mauritius. We stay in a beach villa with a pool| and the kids in a garden villa| behind our block. Definitely better to stay on the far right of the hotel| as this part of the beach is wider and quieter.The multiple boats going up and down all day can get irritating after a while and the number of hawkers pestering one also gets annoying after the second day. The skiing ramp has been moved further from the hotel for this reason| but there is still a lot of activity on the water.In terms of the restaurants| we were sorely disappointed with the main restaurant l'oasis. The service levels are bad| and the food not good for a hotel of this calibre. Tables do not get cleared|and should you go to breakfast or lunch towards the end of the session| its difficult to find a table because the staff just don't bother to clear previously used tables. Food selection at first glance looks to be a lot| but there is a lot of repetition in the lunch buffet| and the standard of the food is not great. The breakfast buffet is fair| but many of the warm foods| like the bacon| ice cold.We then discovered that we could also eat at L'Caravelle on the other side of the resort| and what a pleasant experience. Great staff| beautiful location and more attention to detail. The hotel definitely needs to give attention to L'Oasis.The other restaurants are good for night time eating - our favourite remains the Indian restaurant.A word of warning - drinks are very expensive| absurdly so. It is a pattern in Mauritian hotels| and you feel that you are being ripped off| especially if you go to a supermarket and see what the items cost there.We arrived very late at night and there were trays of food waiting in our rooms. We also departed very early in the morning and there was a selection of fruit| pastries and drinks in reception for us| which was a thoughtful touch.The hotel is obviously looking at cost savings| however they do it in strange ways. In the pool villas| you get a selection of small body creams and face cloths in the bathroom and at night during the turn down service they leave you a little sweet treat on your pillow. These are all missing in the garden villas| yet it is something that you would expect in any room in a 5 star hotel.All the rooms have wifi| however the pool villa's was much slower than the garden villa.The gym is great| the grounds beautiful and the staff generally very pleasant and helpful.Would we return to this hotel - yes| but they need to sort out the main restaurant.,Cape Town| South Africa,12-07-15,Yes,4
Family Holiday,Our first visit to this beautiful island and what a memorable one. We stayed at the TAB for 12 nights and what a wonderful holiday it was!! Right from arrival to the evening of departure there was no stone unturned in the hospitality... With 2 grown up teenagers we stayed in a 2 bedroom pool villa which provided for all the luxury you could ask for| personal butler service-Yuvraj did an amazing job of looking after us and made us a lovely breakfast each morning which meant kids could have lie in and there was no need to rush to breakfast at a given time. The outdoor bathtub and shower gave you that extra tropical feel that we enjoyed thoroughly. With this room you also have a night where they cook a BBQ for you in the villa| which was very enjoyable| and another evening where the chef comes to cook Mauritian food for you too.As this was their winter season we did have a few disappointing days with the weather but this didn't dampen our holiday. All 6 restaurants catered for us very well and even went as far as to cook special dishes for us upon request... Special thanks to Anwar and his team at Il Corallo and Jay at Oasis and Satish and his team at Mahiya.The white sandy beach was sheer paradise and the the varied water sports on offer were amazing!!From the buggy staff (Prakash|Nitin)|to the Management team| Fatima| Prateema and Nilesh were always at hand to oversee that our stay was comfortable at all times| thank you.We will definitely be back!!,northwood,10-07-15,Yes,5
Honeymoon ,At this amazing resort you check in as visitors and leave as part of the family. Impressive and unforgetable honeymoon. Beautiful beach with great activities included| excellent food in all 6 restaurants| especially the Thai and Indian. And the bungalows are spacious with rainforest shower outside. Highly reccomended!,Gurgaon,08-07-15,Yes,5
Amazing stay at TAB,We stayed for 6N/7D at the TAB and had a great time. Family of 4 including 2 kids and we very satisfied right from check-in to check-out. -Great weather (its winter there in June/July) for us escpaing from 45C heat of Delhi-Great water activities all included in your stay at no extra charge. Given occupancy in this low season was 50% there we no lines and waiting :)-Good food across 6 restaurants but would have liked a more exhaustive menu and more a-la-carte options-Good entertainment in the evenings near the bar-Breakfast almost never changed so that should be improved. I mean 6 days of the same breakfast gets boring :(-The blue waters and white sandy beach were nothing short of paradise-They give you just 1 bottle of water upon check-in thereafter one needs to either pay an exorbitant sum for water or (as we did) buy water from nearby local marketStayed at the Junior suite on 1st floor which was adequate. Room size was good but not as plush as a 5 star resort.,Gurgaon,07-07-15,Yes,5
Luxurious comfort in Mauritius,We stayed in a junior suite with outdoor shower for a short stay before departing Mauritius and are frequent travellers to the island.The suite is heaven! The bathroom is out of this world and the amenities and decor immaculate.The restaurant offerings are plentiful and our dining experience was a most welcome one when the local food and cheerful sidewalk restaurants get a bit tired.We thoroughly enjoyed the Thai restaurant and the menu was interesting. The beach in front of the resort was by far my biggest disappointment. I am quite used to the beaches in Mauritius and aware that locals sell their wares to tourists all over the island on the beaches. That being said the strip of beach in front of this resort they are like a 'plague' and the very thing once tries to get away from on a relaxing holiday| becomes real hard work and highly cumbersome. I fully understand that this is not the fault of the resort but it certainly detracts form the overall experience at the resort.,Johannesburg,02-07-15,Yes,5
Although Beautiful Resort BEWARE upon Check-out,We visited the beautiful island of Mauritius on May 1| 2015 through May 13th. The resort is very lovely and the beach is amazing although you must be aware of the many boats that go up and down the beach as well as the coral. Highly recommend sand shoes. Our overall experience with the room and the facility was amazing and we had a wonderful time BUT the resort left me with a very sour taste in my mouth when they overcharged us at check-out. I had not brought my original receipt whereby I paid the hotel back in Sept. 2014 the 50% deposit for our booking. You must be diligent about checking your bill carefully before signing. I was overcharged $350.00 and they refused to work with me. I realized this when I was in the taxi going to the airport to catch our flight to Dubai and back to the States. When I got home| I contacted the resort immediately and they refused to budge. Obviously if you received a quote and paid the required 50% deposit to guarantee the booking| your balance should be the 50% remaining on the bill and any other incidentals. Also beware as they charge your credit card in Euros and yet the receipt says MUR. This is bad business and should not happen. Moral of the story...you always take original quote and receipt of paid invoice and check everything carefully BEFORE signing. This is what you call the fleecing of America! Would I return| my answer would be not to this RESORT! They are Crooks and do not stand by the customer proving that they are wrong although you email all the documentation proving there has been an error. Luckily I used Capital One and my credit card company was able to compensate us for our troubles. Thumbs down to Beachcomber Trou aux Biches Resort and Spa.... SHAME ON YOU!,NYC,02-07-15,Yes,4
The closest you can get to paradise (minus the food)!,We were two couples and two kids staying in a private pool villa. We were really surprised when the hotel upgraded us to a three bedroom villa instead of the two bedroom villa we had booked. What a villa it was. Picture perfect. The whole resort is a mini city by itself. Excellent amenities| staff and everything is perfect.The only drawback I can think of is the lack of vegetarian food on the menu. The hotel must seriously look at either opening a good vegetarian restaurant or increase the veggie spread across its buffets!All in all an excellent experience. Will look forward to stay at other beachcomber hotels!,Bengaluru| India,02-07-15,Yes,5
Paradise Resort..!!,We had a fantastic most amazing stay at this resort. Quick pointers:1) Checkin was smooth and efficient. We requested for a change in the room location which was done promptly. They served nice welcome juice and some cut fruits which was gave a good feeler. 2) Rooms are nice and large. The rooms with outdoor shower are on the ground floor and the basic room in on the first floor with a nice balcony. 3) There are a total of 5 pools. 4 small pools and one really big & large pool. The biggest pool I have seen till date. The ambience around the pool is very relaxing and beautiful with the palm trees and the ocean view. 4) The hotels beach is nice clean with white sands. The beach is literally 700mtrs long and they have unlimited beach beds. One of the best beaches for sure. It is not a fully private beach so you do get some hackers selling shawls| jewelry & others but they are polite and go away if you are not interested. 5) The kids club is one of the best at the resort. It is large| almost the size of a small play school. The staff is amazing and very well trained. They have activities planned for the full day and they also serve lunch and snacks to the kids. I was very impressed. My 4 yr old daughter would spends hours at the kids club. 6) The resort has boat house at the beach and the activities are all free. They have snorkeling| glass bottom boat| kayaking| paddle boats| stand up paddle| wind surfing and even water skiing....all for free. Some of the paid activities are parasailing & deep sea fishing. I enjoyed the boat house the most always doing one activity or the other. 7) The entire staff and service is very good. They are all very nice| humble and ready to help / at your service. 8) The gym is very good with many cardio machines. They also have a teens club where they have Table tennis| Pool and video games. Also they have 6 full size well maintained tennis courts. 9) They have 5-6 restaurants. Most of them serve set menu / buffet for dinner which is tad expensive. We eat at the al-a-carte Italian which was good. 10) The resort also has a Spa...which we did not do.We had a wonderful stay for 3N/4D and were completely satisfied. The resort is overall really huge and be ready to walk around though they do have golf carts / Club cars. Few things which could be added:1) There is no Jacuzzi| steam / sauna. 2) More al-a-carte options specially at dinner time. 3) It is not easy to go out of the resort so keeping a self drive car is a good idea if you want to go out. There are a few restaurants at short drive.,Delhi,01-07-15,Yes,5
True escape!!!,Overall excellent!!! The staff at the boathouse can be a bit more helpfull by sharing some knowledge and insights to the area. Otherwise a good experience with great service| food and accomodation. Vendors are a bit annoying on the beach front.,Cape Town| South Africa,30-06-15,Yes,5
The Most amazing holiday,Overall a great experience. I was impressed with the rooms| the food| the service and the overall ambiance provided by Trou Aux Biches.We did not take our children on this trip however we popped in at the kids club to see for next time and it looked great. I also found that the service provided by Fatima was terrific| she made us feel so welcome. Thank you Trou Aux Biches| I hope we are able to visit again soon.,Cape Town| South Africa,29-06-15,Yes,5
A nice|luxurious and welcoming experience.,We as a family of 5 adults and 1 infant stayed at the Beachcomber Trou aux Biches ( pronounced as true oo beesh) Hotel from 21st to 27th June 2015. We through our agent booked 3 beachfront pool suites on half board basis and as per the offer given by hotel a complimentary light lunch was included in our plan for the tenure of our stay.Our journey from India to Mauritius took 8.30 hours as our direct flight from New Delhi got delayed by 1hour. After landing at the airport the first thing we did was to exchange USD to MUR. There are several counters for currency exchange at the airport and all offer the same rates. For every USD we got 34.5 MUR. The counters opening times coincides with the schedule for international flights.As we had already booked in advance for our transfers so we were received at the airport by a representative of our agent Aqua Sun. Thereupon we were transferred on private basis in a Toyota minibus along with luggage to the hotel. The cost of transfers was very reasonable (@USD 104 both ways) as the hotel is around 64.5 kms from the airport.Our transfer from the airport to the hotel took an hour and fifteen minutes. The airport is very close to Blue Bay so we got our first glimpse of sea right after leaving the airport. The rest of the journey was through sugarcane plantation as it was harvest time there and it being Mauritius's main crop. On the way we passed through Port Louis| the capital city. Trou aux Biches is a village in district Pamplemousses and is situated in the north west part of Mauritius. The Hotel while being on the best beach of Mauritius is also conveniently close to Grand Bay where one can go shopping.We arrived at the hotel at 4.30 pm and were impressed by fact that it is quite enormous and enveloped in lush greenery of coconut| palm trees|etc .We passed through the tennis court on our way to the reception. Where our whole family were warmly welcomed by the hotel staff with a welcome drink and some fruits. At the hotel again we were met by a representative of our agent. Our check in took 15 minutes. We were taken to our rooms on a buggy/cart. We had 3 beachfront pool suites with room numbers 241| 243 and 244. While all the rooms were one after the next| 243 and 244 had an option of being interconnected and were taken taken by my parents and my brother's family and I was in room 241.In the hotel plan the beachfront pool suites and senior beachfront pool suites are located on 1 km length of beach. Above two beachfront pool suites is one single senior beachfront pool suite| which is larger in size and has a bigger pool. But we found our own beachfront suites quite adequate in size with a beautiful plunge pool. In front of the room a glass partition which opened to the deck where 2 chairs| a table and two sun beds were kept beside the plunge pool. Further ahead was 15 feet of sandy garden and then the beach where at least 100-200 sunbeds were kept along the 1 km stretch of the hotel. The beach is at least 30-40 feet wide with a beautiful blue- green sea.So if you faced the sea our rooms were on the right hand side of the property. Near to the reception and 4 restaurants- la oasis| la deck| mahiya and blue ginger and also close to the water sports area. The other two restaurants la caravelle and the Italian one were on the other side of the hotel. So along the stretch of the beach there are beachfront pool suites + senior beachfront suites then watersport activity centre plus 4 restaurants and main pool - followed again by beachfront pool suites and senior suites and then the other 2 restaurants and then again beachfront pool suites/ senior beachfront pool suites. Stay and food for the infants is totally free in the hotel. There is no tray charge while ordering room service for infants. They fulfil every requirement necessary for stay of the infant in the hotel. A multi plug can be requested if you require one.During our stay we had our breakfast and lunch at La Oasis and dinners at Mahiya Indian restaurant except one night when tried Thai food at blue ginger. Our food was prepared on order at no extra charge for breakfast| lunch and dinner as we prefer having Indian vegetarian meals. Food was excellent and we want to thank head Chef Satish at Mahiya who met us every night and prepared excellent meals at dinner. Food at la oasis for breakfast and lunch was good too and our order was taken in advance so that Indian vegetarian meals could be prepared for us. We are also thankful to the chefs at la oasis who fulfilled our every request when it came to preparing food of our choice. At both lunch time and dinner for everyday of our stay Ms. Fatima came to meet us to inquire of our well being. She is head of the Hotel management staff. Our family were taken in by her charm| even my 15 month old nephew who is generally very shy became very cheerful in her presence and wanted to go to her. She meticulously managed and planned our whole stay to the finest possible detail. She even gave us the facilty of a late checkout and allowed us to keep 1 beachfront pool suite and gave a separate family suite (which can accommodate 4 )for our comfort during the day of our departure at no extra cost.  There are also junior suites and family suites through the length of the hotel situated in lush greenery with a pool each for 6-7 suites. The villas are near the spa| sports centre and tennis courts and comprise the back end of the hotel. We did parasailing and tube ride at the hotel beach @ 1200 MUR each and 150 MUR each respectively and it was fun. Glass boat rides| water ski etc were free for all. I myself participated in the tennis tournament at the hotel where the winner was to receive 2 nights all inclusive stay at the hotel. Unfortunately I lost in the very first game as I held the racket for the first time only a day back. Balls| water| racket| towels were provided free of charge to participants in the tournament. On other days (non tournament days) you can buy a pack of 4 balls for 500 MUR rest everything is free.There is also table tennis| gymnasium| kids section| teens area and wonderful spa where we had a relaxing Trou Aux Biches Massage. We booked a 3 full day tour on private basis with our agent. We were transported in Hyundai H1 which is comparatively better vehicle than a minibus. On the first day of the tour we went to Casela Nature Park and Flic and Flac Beach(longest beach). These are on the west side of the Island. On the second day we went to Gris Gris (extreme south point of Mauritius where the sea is very rough and there is a staircase leading to an isolated beach)| Vanilla crocodile park| then passed through Bois Cheri ( tea cultivation)| Grand Bassin and Trou Aux Cerf. The third day we went to the east coast through coastal road first to Belle Mare| then to Ille Aux Cerfs where we took a speed boat ride to see the waterfalls of Grand river and then to the island IAC and then back. We continued through coastal road to Blue Bay and then returned to the hotel to finish our 3 day tour.Places we wished to visit but could not due to paucity of time- Chamarel| pamplemousesses botanical garden| Le morne beach. One can also go for Dolswim and whale watching from hotel beach itself by a speedboat and there is no need to go to La Preneuse beach early morning for these activities.On our final day we went shopping to Grand Bay in a hotel taxi which cost us MUR1000 both way inclusive of waiting of 2 hours.At the hotel a bottle of water is provided free of charge per day and if you need more its @ 100 MUR which is not much as outside its 25MUR. At the end of our 1 week stay at the Hotel we felt that a week is too short a time to truly relax and appreciate Mauritius. As half of our days were spent on tour we felt at least 14 days are needed to tour all the places and relax at the hotel. It also rained a couple of days during our tour and there was no point being at the beach. Weather generally remaining pleasant during the rest of our stay. And we are returning with a nice tan over our natural wheatish complexion. I have always believed that the same place can be heaven for some and hell for others. It's just a matter of ones eyes and ones perspective. Yes there are few persons selling things on the beach like coconut water| strawberries| pearls necklace| offering massages. But they are not intrusive and don't heckle. Yes there are birds of various kinds in large number who will chirp and play around while you eat your food at La oasis. But they don't bother you or pinch your food. Yes there a few bugs like ants who may come by your coffee and tea maker attracted by the sugar. But this happens everywhere where the surrounding is more close to nature.You will enjoy here if you are a beach lover as this is the best beach hotel I saw and stayed in mauritius.,Lucknow| India,28-06-15,Yes,5
too big and pretentious,Great structure and excellent facilities. The spot is excellent as this is my favourite beach on the island. The hotel however is far too big| extremely commercial. It was virtually impossible to get bookings in the restaurants we wanted to eat in (there are 5 or 6 restaurants). When it poured down we had to wait for over an hour for an electric car to pick us up and take us to the restaurant at the other hand of the resort - the structure is so big that indeed you cannot walk under the tropical rain from one end of it to the other (google map will give an idea..),Manchester| United Kingdom,28-06-15,Yes,3
Amazing property and great staff!!!,We went on our honeymoon to Mauritius in Feb and I must say .. one of the best decisions of my trip was to pick this Resort.. on our first day when we entered the resort we felt like a dream come true.. it was that beautiful!! Though we found it difficult to figure out good Veg food but thanks to Chef Satish of Indian restaurant who made our life easy at least for the dinner.Special Thanks to Chef Satish.. | he prepared food specially for us at dinner time that too full 4 course meal of our choice.. over all amazing experience .. i can write an essay about the beauty | services | facilities | beach etc etc of this resort .. thanks a lot Trou aux Biches !! I highly recommend this place!! I will say if you are going for a Mauritius leisure trip you should and must go this resort.,Indore| India,26-06-15,Yes,5
Stunning Resort,From the moment we walked in| it felt very warm and welcoming.The staff are all very professional and always assisting with a smile starting with the concierge staff| reception| all restaurants | housekeeping| room service and even the little mini bar man.All very very pleasant .The rooms are fantastic| the gardens are peaceful and the Beach is the best white sand.Service at all restaurants are up to standard| great wines and great food.Drinks quite affordable for a 5 star.Gym chic and modern.We felt so at home and did not want to leave the hotel grounds.Would highly recommend this hotel for your next holiday.As for us| we would like to say a big thank you to Fatima and her team for making us feel so very special.We will see you next year again for our next holiday or may be again this year.Marilyn and Bernard,Melbourne| Australia,25-06-15,Yes,5
Paradise for the 2nd time !!,We stayed in this Resort for the 2nd time and we were impressed again. The beach| the food | the staff - all is amazing. This is Paradise !! A special THANKS to Bernadette| Ouma| Sanjay at La Caravelle and Ahad-beach| Ahmad-concierge. They made us feel very special and provided excellent service. The rooms are big and we had a outdoor shower. We only found the rooms to be cold.They could be more decorated and there is missing some cosiness. But we recommend this place anyway.,Prague| Czech Republic,20-06-15,Yes,5
BEAUTIFUL RESORT !!!!,It has no defect. Wonderful environment. Excellent food. Lovely staff. Very spacious room. A lot of facilities : several pools| sports center| tennis courts| spa| almost a private beach| etc Perfect housekeeping| Definitely to be recommended.The one and only objection is not due to the hotel but to the country. It is very far from everywhere. Minimum one hour needed to go anywhere.,Alicante,20-06-15,Yes,5
A beautiful hotel that is delightful ,I went with my sister and we have been to other hotels and I really didn't know what to expect| I was amazed and really happy with the hotel it was amazing| the room was gorgeous| the view of the beach from La Caravelle was special| it was paradise and I loved the spa| I would like to go again. Everything from the service was top notch and expected from a 5* hotel| I would recommend to anyone. ,Cape Town| South Africa,17-06-15,Yes,5
It lacked the X Factor,I had not visited the island for several years and was impressed by the new airport and growth of Mauritius generally. The hotel is impressive to arrive at| we were welcomed by dancers and music and immediately got into the festive island spirit.The main reception| pool areas are magnificent| the pool is massive and there are water features everywhere| however the rooms lack character and are very ordinary. The rooms are large and clean with a nice bathroom and shower (although the water was never actually hot)| but the room itself does not feel like impressive at all and is very sparsely furnished.The drive from the airport was about an hour and fifteen minutes and after a long journey| I was tired| this was not helped by the fact that the hotel had put my luggage in someone else's room and it took about two hours to locate| the island spirit was quickly lost and my first nights sleep was disrupted by this frustration.Generally the food is ordinary and I was surprised to find that the service what not what I remembered of my previous visits to the island| in fact I thought the service was actually very bad.The beach is fantastically beautiful| long and filled with water sports available for guests to enjoy| all of which were included. I was annoyed that obtaining beach towels or even service on the beach was always a mission| and considering that this is a beach based holiday| one would expect this to be better staffed and organised. On our last night we had drinks underneath a magnificent tree| and on this night| service was top notch and very well planned and executed. We then dined at the Italian restaurant| which was the best food of the stay.Generally the hotel just seems to lack something| it is nice and Fatima was extremely friendly and helpful| but there was always just something missing.,Cape Town| South Africa,17-06-15,No,3
This hotel is FAR too big.,The hotel has far too many rooms and consequently is much too big to give it any real atmosphere. The staff are not unfriendly| but neither are they friendly nor do they go out of their way to please. The breakfasts and lunches are mediocre at best with very little imagination or variety. Dinners are VERY expensive and you would do well to rather visit some of the nearby restaurants outside the resort - (within about a 10 minute drive).,Johannesburg| South Africa,16-06-15,No,3
Wonderful place to stay,"We have had a great time at the resort. From the start the staff have all been friendly| helpful and efficient and facilities are really good. The selection of onsite restaurants is good and the Thai and fine dining restaurants are particularly recommended. I am in a wheelchair and the access has been fine on all the site. On the one part where there were only steps they put a small wooded ramp in. The ""limited mobility"" facilities in the room were also very good.",Dubai| United Arab Emirates,12-06-15,No,5
Relaxing place to enjoy,Really nice hotel. Excellent spacious clean rooms. Nice long private beach with great selection of water sport equipments available for free of charge. Many different type of reastaurants serving good food. Extremely friendly staff.,Helsinki| Finland,12-06-15,No,5
Almost perfect,The hotel itself is a paradise| yet there is no such thing as nightlife or socializing with others because you simply don't have many opportunities to do so. But that was the only thing missing| otherwise it's a very luxurious place with the most friendly staff.,Teplice| Czech Republic,09-06-15,No,4
Amazing...No better place to be,This is a fantastic resort| run by very good| honest| helpful| friendly people. This was our second visit to the resort| the first one being in 2013 and it was one of the most relaxing holidays that we've been on.The staff:Lead by Fatima| the staff is exceptional in every respect. Fatima herself has set the standards pretty high. Be it breakfast| Check-in| check-out| dinner| she was always there interacting with the guests and making sure everything was good. Our flight was at 10pm| so Fatima arranged a suite for us to use which was very kind and a massive help. As my wife was pregnant| this gesture was of immense help to us. Thanks!!!The staff are very friendly and helpful and catered to every need that we had. Rishi and Satish at the beach were excellent| and took good care of us. Making sure that they were there when we needed them| but not hanging around all the time. Very personal yet private experience at the beach. There was not one single person in the resort| who didn't greet us when they went past| be it at the bar| restaurant| beach| spa| gym| anywhere| which was very refreshing and put a smile on our face.Mahiya| the restaurant: One of the many restaurants in the resort| the service| food| ambiance was perfect. It can't get any better than this. As we are vegetarians| Chef Satish| cooked scrumptious food every day just for us| which was very nice of him. The staff at the restaurant| Pazal| Leckraj| Deep all were great. They treated us like family and took extremely good care of us. We were touched by their love and affection.The beach:A fact that I didn't know before this trip: Troux Aux Biches Resort has the longest beach in Mauritius. And what a beach it is| blue water| white sand| lined with palm trees| stretching for miles. This is what you are greeted with| when you step on the beach. I have never seen a more beautiful landscape. Perfect place to sit| relax| unwind and forget about everything. All beaches in Mauritius are public| so there are a few hawkers every now and again| but they do not bother you if you say no.The room was exquisite| we were in the 300 range| which was near the beach and quite handy for us. The furnishings were very good and ambiance was great.Pools: There is a large common pool with various depths for children and adults| its got chlorine in it to prevent infections etc. and is kept very clean. There are also smaller pools scattered around the resort. So even if the main pool is busy| you can always use these pools which have got sun loungers around them.In the evenings| there is always a musical event of some sort. We specifically liked the Mauritian dance. There is also a Mauritian night at the main restaurant| where you can have all the local dishes. It was fantastic!The spa and the gym are good too| although we used it for only a few days| we never found the gym to be too busy. There are also a few Tennis courts| that are open even after sunset.There is also a kids club| where you can leave your kids for the day and they get to do various activities in the sea as well as in a dedicated area in the resort.There are a lot of activities like snorkeling| para sailing etc which are well organised. On our last visit| we were lucky enough to see a family of whale| so that was fun. There was a mix of all types of holiday makers in the resort| from honeymooners to families with with small children| or teenagers| to older couples. I think this resort offers activities/enjoyment/relaxation for all kinds of visitors which is quite rare.If you want a luxurious holiday in the Indian Ocean then look no further. This is the place to be. We cannot recommend it enough!!! We will be back next year!!!,Windlesham| United Kingdom,08-06-15,No,5
Nice hotel but service to be improved massively,I just came back from Trou aux Biches Resort. My family| 2 adults and 2 children (4yo and 1yo) stayed in a Family Suite for 12 nights.Upon arrival| the staff at the reception was very welcoming and we were driven to our suite which was close to the main restaurant| the main pool and the beach. The suite was very spacious and| as it was at the ground level| the main room was opening directly onto the beautiful garden which was great for our children to play once the sun is gone. They have some Family Suite at the first floor so make sure you ask to be at the ground floor! The only negative is that rooms are very very dark and could do with additional lights.Overall the hotel is good and the amenities are great.- The beach is lovely with white sand and clear water- The main pool is multifunctional with areas with different depth for the babies/children- You have access to a lot of free water sports available: water ski| glass bottom boat| pedal boats| kayaks| windsurfing| snorkelling etc. all except diving.- The kids club has lots of activities available (including water ski for children!) and you can just pop in for some hours or leave your kids for the day. Just be aware that the club closes for a couple of hours between 5 and 7pm which is quite unusual.- There is a large choice of food with 6 restaurants in the evening: buffet| Thai| Indian| Italian and 2 “general food” restaurants- The massages at the Spa are very good and relaxing. The staff is also very very nice.However| to my opinion and having travelled to lots of nice hotels| I wouldn’t rate the Trou aux Bices as a 5-star hotel. The main reason is because of the service you get there and it really let them down. We are not usually fussy about this kind of things but it happened so often that it began to be annoying| especially when you pay a 5-star price.- First| there are not enough waiters at the main restaurant (breakfast and buffet for the diner) and we often had to wait quite long before being able to have someone noticing we were calling them.- The tables were never fully prepared| meaning we were always missing something| cutlery| glass etc. We had to ask every day for more napkins as they were never counting the children as needing one. There is no small spoon on the tables| only large ones which is not practical for children or for eating desserts| so we had to ask for them at every meal. One day| although they saw we were 4| they just prepared the table for 2+highchair… and when highlighting that we needed an additional place prepared they just brought a placemat! Then we asked for the cutlery and afterwards we noticed we were missing a 3rd chair!!! - We found most of the waiters quite unfriendly which is not how Mauritians are in general. They were not very smiley and every time we were asking for something it looked like we were bothering them! Below are just some examples but we had those type of behaviours almost every day:o Once| when asking to have an outside table| we were told that inside was better! Just because the waitress had to put some cutlery on the outside table while a table was already prepared inside! o When asking for a full fat fruity yoghurt at lunchtime for our baby| the waiter replied they only had plain ones and the fruity ones were fat free. He didn’t even check while we saw a large selection at breakfast. o A waitress stopped my daughter and told her that she should put her shoes on when playing around the tables. It sounded more like a “rule” than a nice advice which put my daughter off. I understand that there may be broken glass but honestly| it’s holidays so children are a bit more free to be bare foot.o The last day (5th June) we asked for a yoghurt for our baby and we got one with a best before end of 30th May… (True!!! I took a picture as it was shocking). What kind of 5-star hotel serves yoghurts expired a week before?!?!? When highlighting this to the “headwaitress”| she looked at her colleague and laughed! Seriously| no apologies at all from her. However| to his credit| the waiter who brought us a new one| was very apologetic.- We ordered baby meals to be ready for lunch and dinner. We were told to order at the room service who will then deliver them to the restaurants. The first days they kept sending them to the room and knocking even when the “do not disturb” sign was on the door. This was very annoying as it was always when our baby was napping. What’s the point of putting the sign out if the staff ignores it???All this happened in the main restaurant and I have to say that this is TOTALLY different in the other restaurants. We didn’t try the Indian one but service at the Thai and Italian restaurants were top marks: very attentive and friendly staff!Apart from the service| the other things that could be improved are:- The wooden main pool deck could do with some sanding. A lot of children got splinters from walking/playing on it. Unfortunately a little girl and my daughter got really large and deep ones which required calling the doctor. We got charged £80/100€ for the doctor. This was outrageous| especially when you know that this was because of the bad quality or maintenance of the deck!- We found that the main pool was too much in the shade. And this is coming from someone with 2 young children! The pool is surrounded by palm trees and there are only a couple of seats where you can lie down to tan.- There is no “pool house” like in most hotels. You have beach towels every day in your room but you have to bring them to the pool/beach and bring them back to be replaced (they warn you that you can get charged otherwise!). For us| this was not convenient at all to carry them around.I know that I’m listing a lot of negatives here and it’s obviously not a bad hotel. I wanted to rate it 3.5 stars but it's not an option. We did enjoy our holidays and the children had a great time hence I would give it 4 stars. But we feel that it could have been better and that the hotel should really look at improving some of the things to meet a 5-star hotel standard hence I went for 3 stars.,London,08-06-15,Yes,3
Absolute Paradise...,Wow| an absolute gem on the North West coast of Mauritius. Lovely resort coupled with such great hospitality. The staff became like family| just wanting to help you every step of the way to make your stay even more enjoyable. Great food from the various restaurants - top top quality. The beach itself was fantastic. A crew worked hard every morning to keep it pristine. The kids club was just perfect for a quick activity or two for our 2-year old and the gym was just right for me. Would go back in a heartbeat!! And another mention on the food - really top quality chefs at each of the speciality restaurants. Highly recommend the Full Board package and make it all worth while by taking advantage of the cocktails at the bar - heavy handed at some times with the alcohol but who's complaining - not me. Thank you to ALL the staff at Trou Aux Biches for making our dream holiday. ,Cape Town,05-06-15,Yes,5
To die for! Beautiful resort with amazing Mauritian hospitality,"We were 8 of us heading to Trou aux Biches Resort for a 3-days relaxation trip. I have been to quite a few resorts before and I have to say that TAB is among the top ones I have stayed at. Check-in:Check-in was a breeze. We arrived at 2 pm and we received a very warm welcome from everyone at the reception. The entrance is beautiful; very calm and simple. We got some welcome drinks (very yummy juice and some fresh fruit). We got our room (516) within 15 minutes of waiting. Room:We had 3 adults in the room. They have a very comfortable king sized bed and a single bed (sofa bed). Bed was very soft and pillows were comfy. The room was spacious and very functional. The little patio has a lounge chair and a small dining set (4 chairs and a table). What I absolutely loved was the bathroom. We had an awesome bathtub| an indoor shower and the outdoor shower. The outdoor shower is to die for! The water was super hot and it was private. Wi-fi was reliable and fast in the bedroom. Grounds/beach:The hotel is huge! And the lawns and beach were very well maintained. What I also really liked is that each block has its own pool. If you do not feel like hanging out in the main pool| you can hang out by your own pool which is quieter. The hotel also has clear pavements which is great for running. I got to do 2 rounds of the hotel in the morning. Beach was clean. You do have to walk on some rougher sand to get into the softer part. If you do have very sensitive feet| I would recommend water shoes. But if you are okay with rougher areas (which I am)| it is only 3 steps to get to the softer part. The water is very clean and warm (Canadian standard :) In the early morning| the crew will go along and pick up the bigger shells and rocks.Activities:We made the most of the water sports included in our package. Paddle board| kayak| pedalo. We did not end up doing the glass boat and water ski since it rained 2 days. We participated in the aqua gym session at 11 15 in the main pool and we got to try yoga. At night| the singing band was quite awesome and we got to see the fire show which was entertaining. The fitness centre was very well equipped and we got to play badminton and ping pong. Food:Oh lord! The food was soo yummy! We ate at the Oasis for breakfast and dinner and Caravelle for lunch. I was very impressed. They really catered to all types of eaters but more important| you can taste the high quality of ingredients they use. What was also very impressive is that every day the menu was different. I have been to some hotels where you can see that they have ""recycled"" the food from the day before. But at TAB| everything was very fresh and tasty. Lots of flavour!The big plus! The Mauritian hospitality. Every member of the hotel had a smile on their face| always greeting you. A ""bonjour"" went a very long way. I really appreciate how caring everyone was| especially the people who worked at la Caravelle! Best service ever! I have to say that the guys at the water sports center were also awesome! Always helpful and never felt like you were bothering them at all. A small minus! The spa does not provide free sauna/hammam like many resorts do. You can only use their facility if you purchase a service. Overall - I was very much amazed by the service and the hotel in itself. I would definitely recommend for all types of travellers to spend some time at Trou aux Biches.",Vancouver,01-06-15,Yes,5
Honeymoon Visit in May 2015,"Excellent service and attention to detail. Everything from the pick-up at the airport to the very generous upgrading of my package from half board to full board because it was my and my wife's Honeymoon.The room was a beach facing villa that had a really beautiful outdoor shower| big bath and plenty of room in the bathroom. It also had a little couch to chill on while my wife would get ready for the dinner. Beds where comfortable but I did find that they were two beds pushed together. Found that a bit strange for a Honeymoon suite. Never the less we slept well and woke up to beautiful sunrises. Tours where excellent and we basically booked on our first day through TUB. We did three tours and enjoyed them all but the best one for me was probably ticking ""Swimming with Wild Dolphins"" off my bucket list.Beach was great and you get the feeling you don't even have to leave the resort.Plenty of activities to do there and there is even a Dive Centre there that I used to get my scuba buzz on. We tried all the restaurants and all where excellent. As I said before the service and attention to detail was truly exceptional. They even came and fetched my wife and I when we went out on a bender with some of our local friends and could not quite get home. They came and fetched us. Great Service! Quite pricey but I enjoyed my stay and made some special memories with my wife while I was there.",Cape Town| Western Cape| South Africa,01-06-15,Yes,5
Wow!!,"I have stayed in some swanky hotels| but this hotel pulls out all the stops! Our beach suite villa (101) was one of the best placed on the Island (many thanks to Craig at kenwood Travel for sourcing this for me!). It was enormous| with a separate dressing area| large bathroom with indoor and outdoor shower| a bath and double basins. The bed faced out the large glassed doors directly onto the beach| reminding us much of the Maldives. Our private deck also had a plunge pool which was a nice extra for those hot afternoons. The staff were laid back but attentive in a non intrusive way| and nothing was too much trouble. Yes| as it is on a public beach there were traders everyday| but they were all lovely and I did buy some beautiful pashminas at a snip! Once you said ""no thanks"" they were happy to leave you alone.The food was excellent. We went half board and I wouldn't recommend the extra to upgrade as it still didn't include all drinks. We strolled into the near town (5 mins down the beach) to buy fresh bread and cheese to eat on our deck at lunchtimes with some cold local beers| and this was perfect. Evenings were quiet| but as it was our first holiday without the kids| that suited us down to the ground. The only warning I have is mosquito related - they are hungry little devils| so take plenty of repellant!All water sports are free| and I even learned to water ski which was alit harder than it looks!Would we return...... Of course!",Norwich| United Kingdom,31-05-15,Yes,5
wonderful stay at a lovely hotel in Mauritius,the beachside suites are very nice: beautiful bathroom with an outside/very romantic shower. The Suite is just 5 steps away from the sandy beach.The cleaning is perfect.6 good restaurants give the choice for dining ( mauritian|italian|asian|indian&fish ): just for any taste and any mood ! The staff is just fantastic ! What ever your need..where ever you go : they are just there : smiling|helpful and very efficiant !,Canton of Geneva| Switzerland,26-05-15,Yes,4
Amazing,Had an amazing time at this wonderful resort.I would recommend it to anyone wanting to visit Mauritius.I cant point out any flaws. Simply amazing. The team at the hotel really know how to make you feel special. I would do it all over again.It was the most perfect honeymoon.,Isle of Man| United Kingdom,23-05-15,Yes,5
The perfect escape with your family,We spent two weeks in this amazing huge resort| that can host almost 1000 people without having such an impression of crowded place. This is because of its extension: lots of green areas| big spa| tennis courts| gym| kids club| many swimming pools and restaurants. You can always find what fits to you. We came with our child (2 years old) and it was a great idea. Babies and kids are really welcome and for them there are all the attentions a family may expect. Our daughter was ill and in the evening we could have free dinner for her every day. There is a unique huge swimming pool also with a shallow water area for babies. The poolwater is clean and warm| whereas the sea was with not really perfectly clean water but definitely warm| the first day maybe almost too warm(0: Its bit annoying that the engine boots go back and forth not far from the beach and swimming may be dangerous somehow. Nice food at the buffet restaurant (with some new dishes every day) but there are many fantastic different restaurants: the Indian and Italian are definitely worth a visit. And it's to believe if an Italian tells you that (:Beautiful having breakfast watching the sea and enjoying the walk along the beach. I enjoyed also the water-activities (most are free of charge) and a must is the Dolphins watch at Tamarin bay| even though there are too many boots and people. Different tour operators offer various trips on the island (not to miss a visit to Port Louis) and if you stay for two weeks is a nicealternative to the relaxing moments on the beach. We want to thank the manager of the resort| Fatima| for her kindness and generosity. We had a great time and hope to come back soon. ,Isle of Man| United Kingdom,19-05-15,Yes,5
Beautiful beach holiday| perfect location,"We stayed in a beachfront suite with our own pool| which led directly onto the gardens overlooking the sea| a stone's throw from the beach. The rooms are clean| well-appointed and colonial in style| lots of earthy colours and dark wood (which can be a little dim with the recessed lighting!) and a large bathroom with indoor and outdoor showers - it was lovely to be able to shower (privately!) outdoors among palm trees. The rooms aim for understated elegance rather than sumptuous luxury but are very comfortable and cool.The watersports included in the holiday are fabulous; we snorkelled| paddle boarded and sailed whenever we wanted to| and there was no queueing at all. Being towed behind speed boats| on waterskis or inflatables| wasn't on our relaxing agenda but looked like great fun.The grounds are glorious and beautifully maintained| truly a tropical paradise| and the many garden pools dotted here and there - as well as having our private pool - meant we didn't have to sit around the main pool which was where the families with small children tended to congregate. We hadn't realised it was half-term for some guests so there were rather more children than we would have liked. This was not a problem at all until dinnertime when one particular group of 6 adults let their 4 offspring (aged between 4 and 7) literally run rings around both the dinner table and the staff at 8pm. No comment was passed at all by the parents or the staff and| while I understand that it is a family hotel and therefore children are to be welcomed| there should be a policy regarding acceptable behaviour in public areas. Despite there being a notice in the room that children under 12 were not allowed in a couple of the restaurants| this did not seem to be adhered to either| so check your holiday dates if you want total peace and quiet. We do not usually do full-board holidays| preferring to find our own restaurants; the only place we make an exception is in Dubai. I have to say that compared to the buffets at Madinat Jumeirah| I was slightly disappointed with L'Oasis and La Caravelle. The choice is much more limited| although that makes sense when you think of the destinations themselves| cosmopolitan city versus tiny tropical island| which perhaps makes for an unfair comparison. The food was well prepared and tasty but the buffet stations are open to the elements so there are flies buzzing around and the useless strips of cling-film attempting to protect the food are a little low-rent for a 5 star resort.The a la carte restaurants are much better than the buffets| in order of preference for me they would be Il Corallo (divine)| Mahiya (excellent)| Blue Ginger (tasty) and then Le Deck (a little underwhelming). They are all nicely laid out on wooden decking| surrounded by ornamental pools and lush planting| and the staff are all friendly and enthusiastic (some are more knowledgeable than others). The main downside for me is that you have to book the restaurants in advance. It is fair enough to ask for reservations but it is simply not made clear by the hotel that you need to do this well in advance. On our first night| after a long journey| we could only get a table at 9.30pm. The following day| having read TripAdvisor reviews| I booked all our meals for the rest of the holiday. I managed to change one reservation a couple of days into our stay but| after that| all the restaurants were full a few days ahead. If we hadn't read TripAdvisor| we would have been stuck with the buffets all week.One contributing factor to the fully-booked restaurants issue is probably the fact that the hotel accepts large group bookings. There were two such ""events"" while we were there| an Italian tour and then a Spanish one. While the numbers of people were easily dispersed amongst the grounds| and the hotel never felt overly busy| once or twice one of the buffets was closed to hotel guests at lunchtime without any warning. Fatima (Executive Assistant Manager) was extremely helpful and understanding and could not do enough for us while we were there. She was regularly to be seen walking the grounds and was cheerful and approachable. She is a definite asset to the resort. But the best thing about Trou aux Biches is its location. It is on the lee side of the island| the beach itself is beautiful and clean and lives up to its reputation as the best on the island. We seemed to have the best of the weather judging by the reports from around the island and the sea was calm even beyond the reef. As it is a public beach| there are a few hawkers walking up and down but I didn't find them intrusive at all. We hired the hotel car and driver to take us to Ile aux Cerfs and| en route| peeked at Le Touessrok (from the sea) and actually called in at Belle Mare Plage - Trou aux Biches seemed the better option compared to either of these| in location| beach and property layout.While I don't think it quite hits ""luxurious perfection""| it more than makes up for that with a warm and friendly welcome and laid back tropical charm. All in all we enjoyed a very relaxing holiday in beautiful surroundings and would gladly return (out of school holiday or group vacation season!).",Isle of Man| United Kingdom,19-05-15,No,5
I recently stayed at Trou Aux Biches in Mauritius for the 3rd time.,This is a very beautiful hotel - we had an exquisite senior suite on the beach with its own pool| lounge| outside shower and huge bathroom. There are lots of different dining experiences to choose from as the hotel boasts 7 restaurants - my favorite though was the main dining area for the great selection of well cooked food on offer each evening. The staff especially Fatima made us most welcome. We have a wonderful week and were well rested when we left.,Johannesburg| South Africa,17-05-15,No,4
Villa Holiday - Simply breathtaking,We stayed in the villas at Trou Aux Biches. Simply one of the best holidays ever. Staff were attentive and helpful. Food and choice of restaurants was all outstanding. The spa and sports/water-sports facilities were all first class. Extras were entirely reasonable unlike some other hotels. There are both apartments and villas at the hotel and with the villas| no attention to detail is spared - pre booking of the restaurants| breakfast in the villa| excellent maid service and first class concierge. Idyllic and breathtaking location and you feel you have the place to yourself.,London,12-05-15,No,5
Could be better,"To begin this is a 5* Hotel in the North West of the Island close to Grand Bay. Is it a great hotel - No although it easily could be. The GoodIt has one of the best positions on the island with a fabulous white soft sand beach| lots of Palm trees| clear water| jetty and a close by reef. The grounds are lush and large and the rooms are spacious in small cluster houses with either balconies or patios| spread all over the estate. The hotel also boasts all the expectant amenities such as a great kids club| a small but decent gym| some good tennis courts| a great spa| a large communal pool on the beach as well as a number of smaller individual pools and 6 restaurants This hotel is the right choice out of season as the weather here is the most likely to give you sunshine while it is raining everywhere else. The BadAlthough this hotel has had a revamp about 5 years ago| this was not a great job and it is badly designed and looking tired. I can hardly begin to tell you in how many ways it could have been improved| but it is simply lacking finishing touches everywhere. The rooms are big and well appointed but who puts the minibar into a bathroom ??? Why is half the room empty with bare walls ? The lighting is shocking and the rooms are simply not well designed. The chairs in the main restaurant are old and grubby| the outside bar and ""lounge"" is a joke and could have been designed better by my grandmother. The whole complex is in the typically but old fashion earthy tone in tone colour scheme| and you would be forgiven to think you were in an old age home (albeit there a plenty young children to quickly squash this feeling). The UglyFortunately there is nothing really ugly| hence this is still a 5* resort. However this is only because of its beach and location. Everything else is defentitely no more than 4* and if you are used to luxury resorts across the world| you will be disappointed.Having said all of the above| when you are looking for the best possible weather during the rainy season and a great beach| this is still the right choice because who wants to be in the room when there is a great beach calling. I can only imagine how great this Hotel could be| if a good interior designer was to get his or her hands on this and turn it into one of the best Hotels on the island",Dubai| United Arab Emirates,02-05-15,Yes,4
Average large hotel| impersonal and bland,"We went with two 14yr olds and two twenty something boys. My husband chose the hotel because it looked like it had plenty of activities. The gym| tennis courts and watersports were used a lot. I'd expected lots of yoga/ meditation/ pilates classes. There was one yoga class a week! I got a lot of books read ! The hotel was large and spread out| the rooms nice if you like everything dark. We had a beachfront room with sitting room terrace and pool which was good | and a useful base for all to gather. There were about 5 restaurants and a buffet restaurant. You had to book well in advance for the restaurants and on 4 occasions our booking had been messed up and we had no table. The food was mostly average' we liked the Indian best. The buffet restaurant at the far side of the site was much nicer than the central one and was run superbly by Menon (sp?) he was delightful. We booked a car one day| advised by the hotel it would be really quiet| it was the last day of the local holidays and the roads were jammed. We went to the newly opened ""Nature Reserve"" in the south. It was extremely expensive| locals pay half price| teeming when we went |and like a budget West Midlands safari park . Do NOT go there! In fact there's no where much to go| which is ok if you just want to relax. I went to 20 degrees Sud last year| it was a million times better! Will not be returning to Troux Aux Biches",Stratford-upon-Avon| United Kingdom,01-05-15,Yes,3
Every effort made to please.,We stayed in a Family Room which has two bedrooms/two bathrooms/outdoor shower and veranda overlooking the gardens with table and four chairs and one (?) lounger. It was very spacious and kept very clean throughout our stay. We stayed over the v busy Easter break when service in the main buffet restaurant was strained to say the least. We brought this to the attention of the management and in fairness| Jerome who was our contact couldn’t have tried better to resolve the issue which was due to them not having a current restaurant manager but were in the process of recruiting one. The hotel is situated on a long beautiful beach which is very narrow when the tide is in and you have the constant drag of traders trying to sell you jewellery| shells| sarongs| bags etc which is all done in a pleasant and none hassling way. The hotel is set in beautiful gardens which are stylish and well maintained and most rooms are set around a large lovely pool which is in addition to the main central swimming pool which was very busy and too crowded for us.The choice of restaurants is excellent as a repetitive buffet can become a bit boring over 14 days. Food in all is excellent but service in some is better than others.The Spa was wonderful and very much worth a visit at least once. The kids club seemed very popular but our 9 year old only went once as she felt it was a little babyish. Can’t comment on the teen club as our teen wasn’t interested! Water sports provision was good with well-maintained equipment which was all free. There was varying evening entertainment - some good| some not so but the fire eating/dancing display is worth watching.Staff are more than willing to help and all work hard to please.We had a lovely| pampered| relaxing stay made all the more special by the attentive staff. Overall| this is a relaxing upmarket resort which deserves it’s 5 star rating and I would whole heartedly recommend it to both families and couples.,Salisbury| United Kingdom,20-04-15,Yes,5
Beautiful hotel but service needs improvement,"My husband| my teenage son and I spent 9 nights here in April 2015 in a 2 bedroom family suite. The weather was an unpredictable mixture of sun and cloud - completely out of the control of the hotel but perhaps worth knowing if you are thinking of visiting at this time of year.First| the positives:- our family suite was huge and well appointed| with two lovely bathrooms and a (very private) outdoor shower| which was a nice novelty- the food quality was probably the best we have ever encountered in a hotel. We booked tables in the various restaurants on every night but one| and would particularly recommend the Indian| where both the food and service was superb. Our son has Coeliac Disease| and the staff at all the restaurants took this very seriously and still managed to make him varied| interesting and delicious food - a big thank you to them!- the hotel grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained by teams of people| including the beach which was cleaned daily- the spa is lovely and I enjoyed two very relaxing massages there - though disappointingly you can only use the spa area if you are having a treatment- my husband and son thought the tennis coaching was effective| and of the tennis courts two were good quality carpet and four are adequate concrete- there are a variety of dive sites and preparation and safety are comprehensive- the complimentary glass bottom boat trip was enjoyable- we don't generally enjoy ""evening entertainment"" in hotels| but many of the singers in the restaurants and bar were genuinely good and added to the ambiance. The fire show was impressiveThe negatives:- our major gripe on this holiday concerns the ""Teen club"" - or lack of it! The teens club was a major reason why we booked this hotel| as a way for our son to hang out with other teenagers whilst we had time to relax as a couple. However| after arriving for scheduled activities only to find the teens club area locked up| including several evenings where it was pitch dark and on the last one we could clearly hear a group of stray dogs barking nearby| we complained to the management. They promised improvement and asked us to return at 10am the following morning when they promised there would be something going on... only for the staff member to stroll up at 10.20 with nothing planned until the afternoon... we gave up!- the service at breakfast was poor at peak times. Although the official end of service time was 10am| if you didn't get there by 9am you never had the full complement of cutlery (I generally used the handle of my fork to stir my coffee)| and you had to chase someone down to get coffee or tea. There was no fresh juice (it was the sweetened out of a carton variety)| and usually no clean glasses to put it in| either.- the hawkers on the beach could be wearing| as they approached your sunbed regardless of whether you were reading| talking etc and persisted after you said ""no""| but were polite and genial- the small pools set around the hotel grounds amongst the villas would have been lovely to use| but the one near our villa only had a handful of loungers around it- both the small pool near our villa and the main pool had loungers set almost entirely in the shade - great if you have small children perhaps| but not good if you were hoping to get even the slightest tan on your beach holiday| especially given the amount of cloud cover- my husband was stung by a jellyfish on our first day there| which meant I could sit on the beach and not swim| or swim in the pool but be forced to sit in the shade under the cloudy sky....!All in all| I would say this resort has some very strong positives| but needs to tighten up its service levels and make sure it delivers the services it promises| such as the teens club. If you run activities haphazardly teenagers lose interest. On this basis I would not return to this resort.",London| United Kingdom,18-04-15,Yes,4
Amazing family holiday - don't look any further,We arrived back from Trou Aux Biches a week ago - can not recommend enough for a family holiday - it was perfect. The beach is gorgeous and a real bonus that you could walk all the way into the local town (which we did to buy cheap rum to mix cocktails in our room and enjoy sundowners on the deck) and also that it is only 'one sunlounger deep'. So you have no one in front or behind you and with young toddlers they can happily play at the waters edge whilst you get the chance to stay on the sunlounger.The kids club was phenomenal - primarily because of Jonathan who made it so much fun. We lost our 6 year old to there and had to keep begging him to come out to play with us for a while.The water sports were great - most you can just walk and get on - paddle boards| sea canoes| windsurfers and a few you needed to book a day in advance e.g. the hobby cats. The hotel glass bottom goes out 3 times a day and is ideal for younger children.We found the buffet food incredibly good given the amount of people that it needs to serve - there was even an oyster bar for Easter. Highly recommend spending the money on the weekly 'lobster night' on the beach. Entertainment was good in the evenings - in particular the fire show on the beach.Yes it is a 'large' resort and the main pool did get a bit busy| however the smaller pools dotted around the villas were very quiet. Yes there were quite a few beach sellers - but nothing compared to a lot of Europe - I suggest if you do want to buy anything leave it until your last day - they definitely inform each other once you make a purchase.We went out from the beach on one of the local water taxis for 45 minutes only when there were dolphins - and saw loads of them. What a memory for the kids - swimming with dolphins!The hotel has a good shop and we found the staff - in particular the room service and room cleaners - lovely and friendly. The only two 'faults' - and they were tiny in comparison the how amazing everything else was - were the 'darkness' of the rooms - a few extra lights would not go amiss. And also the price of some of the cocktails - so easily London prices. Lovely| but local rum is so cheap....It was an amazing place and we would highly recommend,London| United Kingdom,14-04-15,Yes,5
What a disappointment throughout: not a 5*,Although the hotel was renovated 5 years ago| it feels run down and shabby. Most of the sun beds by the pool were ripped. The whole feel is old fashioned| dark| brown| beige and bland. The bedrooms are huge| but totally soulless and cold. The food in the buffet is worse than a 3 star hotel. They can't even make nice cocktails. Most of the staff is dull and never smiles (very unusual in Mauritius). The beach is very narrow and so overcrowded and busy: not peaceful at all. We had booked 5 night there| but wanted to leave the minute we arrived. The manager (or assistant manager) was the only nice and efficient person| but she obviously could not fix those major gripes. We ended up leaving after 3 night and we won't go back for sure.,london,13-04-15,Yes,2
One of the best hotels!,Everything is 5 star rated at this hotel. From the welcome they give you| to the food| room service and everything else included. Staff is very friendly and very well trained in their job aspect. They never give you a chance to complain about anything. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who's willing to spend a little extra for the best service in the hotel industry. The resort is huge with numerous restaurants| pools water activities. It's very quiet and even family friendly. The hotel rooms are in excellent shape and very well maintained. Food served is amazing. If given a choice I would definitely stay in this hotel again.. ,Singapore| Singapore,13-04-15,Yes,5
Great resort for our family,Thoroughly enjoyed our four days here before we moved to a different resort on the east coast. Our room was fantastic - we went for a family villa so our teenagers were with us| but had their own separate room and their own bathroom. We were just to the right of the main restaurant which was hugely convenient for eating and the beach sports. The room was extremely comfortable and had a large terrace| and - best of all - an outdoor shower which was a great treat. We ate at three different restaurants in the evenings - the food at the Italian was exceptional| and the Thai equally so - they had a taster menu which was delicious and the service in here was particularly good. Breakfast could be taken at the main buffet| or further along the beach - there was plenty of variety at each| and we enjoyed having our omelettes freshly cooked| and my son especially enjoyed the waffles and pancake stations! We also had a light buffet lunch each day which had lots of salad choices| plus fresh grilled fish and burgers and pizza so catered for everyone. There are lots of birds around the tables| but they are not a pain and it is the same all over the island. We spent a lot of time on the beach and the water sports were enjoyed to the full - the water skiing was particularly good| and both the children were soon up and enjoying this. We went on two snorkelling trips which were great| both inside and outside the reef - you need to book these ahead| and they are definitely worth doing. There are people trying to sell you stuff on the beach - as it is public - but there was never a problem saying no| and having holidayed on beaches in Southern Spain many times| there were far fewer than out there!! The beach itself is beautiful and the hotel keep coral and rocks to a minimum - walking away from the hotel frontage you can see what a good job they do. We didn't feel a need for shoes to wear in the water at all. The gardens are beautiful| and the vista from the reception area is great. All in all we would recommend this very highly. It is a big site| but never felt over crowded| and we relaxed from the moment we arrived. We booked through Scott Dunn who were excellent in every respect| even making restaurant reservations in advance for us.,Leicestershire,10-04-15,Yes,5
A dream,We enjoyed the whole stay from the beginning to the very last minute. Everything was just wonderful so that we'd have preferred to stay some more days or even weeks... The food in the different restaurants was invariably very tasty and at the bar we had some very delicious drinks. The breakfast buffet left nothing to be desired.We would like to come back soon!,Zurich| Switzerland,08-04-15,Yes,5
Nice| not wow,"SUMMARYOnly 3 stars as I am scoring based on expectations of a 5 star hotel - Average.A great one stop resort with a lovely beach| variety of places to eat| water sports| tennis| and spa. It's design is very natural taking all its cues from nature. If you're looking for full 5* and high quality buffet| you maybe disappointed.

Mixed feelings,We received an excellent welcome and ms chutoo who was on duty that day was most attentive. The room was spacious| well laid out| clean and had all the amenities. I was however disappointed with the animation team. Two classes were cancelled one because external instructor didnt turn up and the other as it was raining. I was most disappointed with the attitude and the lack of concern when that happened. Should it be the client who has to request alternate back up activity and plead for a replacement class?Food in the main restaurant was just fine. The restaurant by the beach was much better,Bengaluru| India,31-03-15,Yes,4
Paradise! Memories for a lifetime..,Did extensive research on hotels in Mauritius and this one suited the most for couples seeking the following -1) Beautiful| serene and tranquil location2) Good Weather in the North West compared to rainy south3) Availability of vegetarian meals - Ask for Chef Satish from Mahiya - He even prepared meals for us when we reached half an hour after scheduled closure4) Opted for full board package as resort has enough to offer for a whole week5) Great water activities included as part of package. Proximity to other Scuba diving centers6) Helpful staff - amazing rooms - opted for Beach Junior Suite7) Foliage in the hotel is amazing - clean air - came back thoroughly refreshedWould love to come back again soon in lifetime..Kudos to Trou Aux Biches and Beachcomber6) Sea just looks great. Photos come out amazing,Bengaluru| India,28-03-15,No,5
Luxury and Paradise,"Fantastic hotel| fantastic beach. Like living in a botanical garden.The open reception is beautiful on arrival. We stayed in a junior suite (the cheapest room)| it was big and very beautiful with a balcony| nothing cheap about it. Perfect cleaning. The room was close to the beach| restaurants and gym/tenniscourts| which is nice| as most of the villas were a long way from these places as the resort is pretty big. But I noticed that people were picked up in golfcars.There was always a sunbed for us on the beach| no need for ""the towel-hysteria"" and the water was great and warm. Many water-activities| so always something to do if you get to relaxed.The staff was very helpfull in generel but not overly kind in the way they spoke to us. One complaint only:One evening we wanted to eat at the hotels Thai-restaurant and one of the other restaurants had a lobster-event - which would cost extra (we already had the Full-board-package). We didn't want to go to lobsternight. The lady who was in charge of the dinnerbookings (you have to book a table every night!) was not very nice and told us we could not have a table!! When we complained in the reception they called the restaurant and got us a table anyway - and the waiter here was very surprised that we werent able to get a later booking since they had a very slow night| due to Lobsternight!! We took it as a very poor attempt at pushing us to lobsternight - and paying more money... BUT that was our only complaint with the place. Other than that the staff at all the restaurants and bars were great.Since we were flying out very late the night we left| we got to stay at our room| at no extra expense.So all in all - very very nice stay",Copenhagen| Denmark,28-03-15,No,5
You need more than exotic plants/architecture to make a 5* hotel,I thought we were going to Paradise but were very disappointed. The hotel is nice| but you need more than exotic plants and architecture to make a 5* hotel. People are very kind but lack a sense of things. We only had breakfast at the hotel as we were served the same 2 “plastic” sliced cheeses for breakfast every day| no fresh fruit juice (in Mauritius!!!) soggy waffles piled up etc. The beach (supposedly one of the best on the island) was 4 meters “wide”| so the deck chairs taking up 2 of these 4 meters| left 2 meters left for people to walk on. Every 5th minute somebody would try to sell you something in an insisting way; cosmetic surgery| plastic bracelets| baskets| massages| excursions and you name it. They would come and talk to you even if they saw that you were reading or sleeping. Just so annoying to be disturbed all the time! There were lots of dead corals on the beach| and in the water| so it was not pleasant going into the water| or to go for a walk on the beach. We went around to look for other beaches and couldn’t find what we consider a nice beach on the island. Ok| the sand is very white on some beaches| but no beaches are long or wide and when you can’t walk on them because of stones| dead corals| sea urchins| seaweed etc – it’s difficult to call it a nice beach. You have to pay just to enter the Spa. It is very difficult to find something qualitative on this island. In Grand Baie one can find about 50 “brand” stores| in which most articles are “copies”. Traffic is dangerous on the island; many drive on drugs or/and drunk. If you’re white and you have an accident| it will be your fault for sure – unless you know somebody “at the top”. On the highway you have people| walking with prams| biking| running| sitting down to eat etc. Corruption is everywhere. A sign in front of an exchange office – “rates negotiable” - it’s a real 3rd world country| where not much functions. The day before our departure I’d emailed our boarding passes to the reception to be printed. When I go to pick them up I see that I was given 6 other persons’ boarding passes. When I told him that these were not our boarding passes| he asked me – are you sure?!... Well| I think I know my name. Unfortunately| the list is long with things that don’t work at this place. If you have seen other beaches in the world| you know that this is not a top one.,Geneva| Switzerland,25-03-15,No,2
Really great location and lay out,I have stayed here twice now on both times I have been here for work and not leisure so have not had the opportunity to enjoy all the leisure facilities that go with the hotel. It is always a pleasure to be able to enjoy some of the beautiful location that is Trou aux Biches.The villa suite that I have stayed in on both occasions| I have really enjoyed. I guess if you want to see the sea then a sea front villa would be best| but they do have foot traffic in front of you and are less peaceful then those further back in what can best be described as a small residential village of clustered villas.The food is not impressive and in fact is poor for a resort of this standard and the service I would put as helpful but average. The location really makes the place special.,East London| South Africa,25-03-15,No,4
Fantastic tropical location,A large five star property situated in the north coast of Mauritius with fantastic beachfront location and water gardens covering a large area … able to accommodate round 800 people at capacity I believe.There are at least four restaurants| the deck bar area| a spa| sports club| tennis courts| multiple pools| hectares of lush gardens and foliage and a fleet of buggies which buzz around constantly servicing the various activities and areas.The thatched lobby looks out to the ocean in the distance with extensive landscaped water gardens full of Palm trees and walkways to the public areas and restaurants - all very pleasant| together with a nice air of calm and tranquility!The rooms are 'villa' style and laid out in sections - the map on the key card is helpful until you get to know your way around.My room was nice and spacious with a large balcony which I didn't have the time to use! The room was basically well designed but the lighting could do with a re-think - it was a bit dingy - although I am sure the hotel would tell me this is 'moody' ... But sometimes there's a fine line!The desk area at the back immediately after the door was a little cramped| but it worked in terms| of design| The bathroom was large and included a wet shower and a full bath with was great and two basins. The water pressure was a little low| and it could use a bit more attention to detail - face towels you would normally expect in a 5 star and also they need to upgrade the towels to 'soft white and fluffy' rather than 'thin| grey and sad' - in realize that towels are probably not a priority in Mauritius| but this is a 5 star resort with 5 star prices| so in this instance … it is important. A proper box of tissues would be great as well| rather than the little packets like toilet-paper!I grappled with getting a comfortable temperature - somewhere in the middle of oppressive humidity and deep freeze (with the AC on!) in the room. Unfortunately when I turned the AC off completely the condenser units leaked water extensively over the floor which boosted the in-room humidity and made the stone surfaces like a skating rink!After trying different combinations of balcony doors open and AC on low| after about 3 days I arrived at a compromise that was acceptable...The staff generally were friendly and helpful.The free WIFI was erratic. When he weather closed in (there was a tropical cyclone present for most of the week I was there) - not surprisingly – it deteriorated! The speed was fine| but the bandwidth was a little challenged. For most guests I am sure it worked adequately... And by the end of the week - and a few requests to reboot the router emitting signal to my room - I had become friends with the IT guy! Very helpfully also allowed me access to their conference WIFI in the lobby. I gratefully used this to up and download hundreds of hi res images - I was working on an intense corporate event - each day there was massive amounts of data I needed to move in both directions.The event on which I was working on made use of all the onsite restaurants - and the Indian Mahiya| the Italian Il Corallo and the International beach-front buffet next door – La Caravelle - were all great| the vibe in Le Deck Bar was usually good| only the Oasis buffet for lunch was a bit underwhelming food wise!I was in full on working mode whilst there| and that gives a completely different perspective to someone on holiday or visiting for relaxation … and I am sure it’s a fantastic place for chilling.,Oxford| United Kingdom,22-03-15,No,4
Great hotel and great staff,I visited here in March with my wife| and three children. The hotel is really beautiful| big spacious rooms with outdoor showers. Our family room also had a second bedroom with two single beds which was great for the kids. There is also a small pool shared by every few rooms which is great as it is mostly empty and we got to enjoy it to ourselves. There are six restaurants but you really have to book a few days in advance as they are always very busy. Food isn't that great| and the room service menu really needs to be redone. I think most of the guest go out in the evenings for dinner| but with two four year olds and one toddler| this really wasn't an option for us. The biggest problem we had was with the flys. We had breakfast every morning at Caravel| which is beautifully designed| open air restaurant with a gorgeous view of the beach| but the amount of flys just spoilt it for us| they are everywhere| in the buffet area| on your table| crawling over your food. I really can't understand why management allows such an easily solved problem like this to spoil such a beautiful place especially after all the work and effort the staff do to please the guests. The beach is simply gorgeous and there are so many water activities that you are guaranteed days and days of fun. Fatima the manager is top notch| she met us upon arrival and made sure special care was taken with the food my wife packed for our one year old. The rest of the staff were just as great. They really made our stay very pleasant. Super friendly and always responded immediately if we had any special request. On our fourth night my youngest came down with a fever and although we had packed a digital thermometer my son pushed the baby stroller into the pool on the first day we arrived soaking the thermometer and my wife's iPhone along with other things. We called the front desk and even though it was almost midnight they managed to get us a brand new digital thermometer and because it came with no batteries they kindly sent a lady a few minutes later with a set of batteriesThis is our first stay at a Beachcomber hotel| and other than the food (we only tried caravel| oasis and room service) and the flys in the restaurants I would highly recommend this hotel. ,Khartoum| Sudan,20-03-15,No,4
Can't wait to return,"My wife and I visited this fantastic resort back in September 2014 but I forgot to post a review. However| it was that good that I cannot forget anything about the Trou Aux Biches experience. We had a superbly spacious apartment (room 100) which was almost on the beach at the northern end of the resort| the room featured an outdoor shower which was lovely.The resort features six great restaurants| five of which do need to be pre booked but| with a little planning| this is not difficult. You will soon find your favourite to revisit. We particularly enjoyed the Caravelle where the food style was modern French with island influences and where the service could not have been better. Having said that the service element throughout the resort is top notch| from main reception to the guys maintaining the garden the service was extremely polite and efficient.We visited the spa for a relaxing massage| we walked the immaculate beach where we sun bathed on the comfortable hotel provided loungers. OK| we needed to cope with the beach hawkers but these guys understood a polite ""no thank you"" and they learn quickly that you were not buyers and left well alone.We will be returning to this wonderful hotel as soon as we can. Thank you also to Beachcomber UK for your excellent service; it was much appreciated.",Warrington| United Kingdom,14-03-15,Yes,5
Did NOT fully live up to expectation,"We have been to Maurtius on a number of occasions and this time we decided to try this resort - The Good:1) Beautiful Setting2) Nice Beach3) Lovely Rooms4) We were given an upgrade on our accommodation| to a room with an outside shower5) The Italian Restaurant was exceptionally goodThe NOT so good:1) We had a mouse in the room for 3 days. The resort did try to resolve the matter by putting mice traps| however| at no stage did they suggest / offer that we move to another room2) Could not get a good Espresso - had to return it 5 times but the staff did try to please3) My husband cut his finger and after going to First Aid| we could not get a ""plaster/band aid"".. We were told to "" buy one "" at the general store at the resort - after showing our disapproval at the response| 3x plasters were delivered to our room4) On one particular occasion| during breakfast the food buffet area was not covered with fly nets and the food was infested with fly's. On pointing this out| they did resolve.In general| we feel we had a "" better"" experience at ""The Paradis"" than at this resort| however| it can still be regarded as Very Good.",Johannesburg,13-03-15,Yes,4
Stunning,We stayed here last September and after several visits to Mauritius after being recommended by Marie at Seyexclusive. We were travelling with our friends and their children and it was great the rooms were beautiful and we went for the beachfront pool room and I didn't want to leave. Our Friends room was the family room which had a second room attached to the master however it was the perfect size for them.The food was very good and we travelled out to Grand Baie a couple of times which was rather busy for us however it was something we had to do.Great hotel and we would return in the future.,Birmingham| United Kingdom,12-03-15,Yes,5
TROU AUX BICHES - OUTSTANDING,We opted for some winter sun in December and selected Mauritius as its their summer season. We also flew direct with BA from London so no stopovers. Our resort had to provide full board| a great beach and not busy. At Trou Aux Biches we were not disappointed and we opted for their Full Board plus as some drinks were included at lunch time and at dinner. The resort is part of the Beachcomber group which we have stayed at before so we knew the high standards of service and facilities would be evident. Food was excelent| beach was stunning| and the whole holiday was totally relaxing - we were not disappointed at all. We booked all the holiday through Seyexclusive as they provided competitive quotes and had good knowledge of Mauritius. They also handled our private transfers to and from the resort.,Northampton| United Kingdom,11-03-15,Yes,5
Been there| done that!,Security very good. Gardens and grounds beautifully kept. Reception smart and staff very helpful.Booked Beachfront Suite which looked onto the public beach. The beach was not as I expected. There was a lot of sea weed on the beach. Maybe it was the time of the year for sea weed! The water sports were great| and free. The pedelos were fun. Don't forget to take good sun lotion as I burnt my feet badly in 20 minutes. The glass bottom is good for all ages. Take some bread! All the restaurants are worth a visit. Book two days a head in case of disappointment| they get busy. There were a lot of flies on the food in the L`Oasis restaurant| but that's what you get in hot climate.Watch the birds| cover your food with a napkin if you have forgotten something| and have to go back to the buffet area. The floors are often slippery in the L`Oasis | they seem to have trouble controlling melting water and humidity. We saw quite a lot of people with disabilities. The complex is designed well to cope with wheel chairs| and child buggies. We visited some temples|( don't forget to take off your shoes ) you are welcome to look round and take photos. There is also a Botanic Garden. Costs about £2 to enter. There is not a lot to see in area. We took local buses which were cheap| and it was a good way to meet the local people. The roads are busy but in good shape. They drive on the left. They don't have many maps| be prepared to ask the locals for directions.Barter in small shops and with hawkers on the beach| they expect you to!,Louth| United Kingdom,11-03-15,Yes,5
Disappointingly turned away. . .,Currently staying on the Island at another exclusive 5 star hotel we decided to rent a car to explore the island further. Having been recommended Trou aux Biches we decided to stop off to have some lunch and look around the hotel for future stays on the island. After being abruptly told by the security at the gate that they are too full (interesting as all other luxury hotels on the island are not at full capacity at the moment!) with 50 guests in house. We politely asked if we could speak with reception to arrange to come inside to have lunch and look around. We were not allowed to use the phone to internally speak to reception and we would not be helped further. Having visiting other 5 star resorts on the island and been warmly welcomed| our impression of the rude and poor attitude of Trou aux Biches left us very disappointed. Having visited Beachcomer resorts before and having excellent service this leaves little to be said about Trou aux Biches.,London| United Kingdom,05-03-15,Yes,1
Excellent!,Long beach| white sand| blue ocean| great hotel! Beach is not private. But it approx 2 km long (yes it is! 2 km of hotel). Ocean is very clean| service and food are excellent. Perhaps you should take a taxi to get anything. That is why location just 4. ,Cirencester| United Kingdom,02-03-15,Yes,5
Chill out and forget everything,Wonderful tropical setting for this suites and villas Hotel. Clean and beautifully kept rooms and other areas. Staff very friendly and helpful. 12 hour flight overnight by Air Mauritius - very good in business class wouldn't like to go economy at this duration (age!).Food was good especially as this is obviously an Island with importations - personally I didn't care for the supplements required for certain dishes in some of the restaurants. We booked 2 weeks half board and would expect to be offered the complete range of choices without the extras.Lots of hawkers on the beach but quite friendly - perhaps a bit boring after a while.But for a chill-out holiday on a lovely Island - hard to beat! Gentle people,Cirencester| United Kingdom,25-02-15,No,4
A wonderful hotel...,We stayed here after a safari and I am glad to say they helped with the reintegration back into normality. The food and service is outstanding and the activities were very good. My daughter was unwell and they attended to her very quickly. The wifi was possibly a little weak away from he rooms and front office| but it's not a problem.,London| United Kingdom,24-02-15,No,5
Everything it ought to be,This was the most recent in over 10 stays in Mauritius. This was a 10 year anniversary celebration| we honeymooned at Trou Aux Biches 10 years ago. The revamp that's been done is beautiful. The rooms are well done and maintained - the smaller private pools in each clusters garden were great. Staff are super friendly| and Fatima| the hotel manager makes a point of seeing all guests at least once a day and knew us all by name. There are so many personal events that impressed us| a really nice one being the cake presented at a restaurant wishing us a happy anniversary. The spa by Clarins as well as the Mares Drive Centre were excellent. The hotel has 6 restaurants| just make sure to book as some get quite busy. Food quality was excellent| each restaurant with its own flavor and expertise. The town of Trou Aux Biches is really nice too. We were alone without our young children this time - although the hotel caters for kids| I think my own would have been frustrated here. It's predominantly French speaking and in truth I think there are Mauritian hotels far better suited to English speaking small kids. I would hesitate to return here.,germany,20-02-15,No,5
Heaven on earth,From the breathtaking clear beaches| to the scenic swimming pools| state of the art service| dreamland chalets| to the great food| peaceful atmosphere....I could not see anything wrong here. I think coming here on business was torture..this is a place only for vacation,germany,16-02-15,No,5
Thought it was a slice of heaven on earth but what a disappointment!,Stayed at the resort recently for 1 week paying 5000 Euro for 2 adults and a baby and I must say loud that we were not satisfied at all even though the staffs were friendly and the hotel along with location and beach is great.During our stay it rained a lot. Of course we can't blame the hotel for bad weather but definitely blame them for bad ventilation system which caused mold in our bathroom| room as well as my stuffs. We are always going to Mauritius every year in Dec-Jan and used to high humidity so this was not new to us. On top we did not use the AC as there was no way to set the temperature of the AC so it would be quite cold in the room and obviously we did not want to be back to home with our 2 yrs old child being sick. Therefore we used the fan only and also had the doors open for air to circulate every time we were around. Also if switching on the AC when leaving the room| the cold air would make the floor wet and it took very long to dry.At first my Birkenstock and Geox sandal became moldy and the staffs told me that because I used it in the rain that's why. But I did leave them to dry for 2 days. Anyway| my Guess sandal was not used in the rain as well as my Prada mocassins which was in my shoes bag in the dressing room| these also had mold. What also quite annoyed me was the mattress protector which was in a disgusting state - found this through my child trying to sneak under the sheet. Not to describe how the baby blanket was. This resort has definitely a lot of points to improve if they don't want more guests to write such kind of comments.Finally we were offered to move to another room which we did but regret this now. We should have simply moved to another resort rather than staying there. To my great disgust I found out that the toilet was not cleaned properly as I could see the some leftover business of the previous guest on the toilet body (lower part - outside) which was finally cleaned after I pointed it out.Cannot recommend this hotel unless they specifically review their ventilation system.,germany,11-02-15,No,2
The best stay!!!,I had a great stay here. I love that you are near the beach and the resort is full of nature with a swimming pool and great restaurants.Please do note that the Thai and Indian restaurant don't accept people 12 or younger.The food is delicious and the beach is full of fun activities where you can also exit through to go to places near the town including restaurants and pharmacies.It's a very nice hotel and I definitely recommend it!,London| United Kingdom,10-02-15,No,5
Luxury everything,Large hotel with excellent facilities. The rooms are modern| large| private and stylish. Few overlook the ocean but then spend more time at the beach! Food was good and staff the same. It is a large luxurious hotel not a boutique hotel so it's your choice what you want.,Greater Johannesburg| South Africa,08-02-15,No,4
Absolute Paradise,Spent 10 days here with my family and it was an absolute dream come true. Clear sea| great food and a relaxed atmosphere. The activities on offer are brilliant| with a the gym and tennis courts getting a lot of use. A great place to jog around| if just to enjoy the outdoor air. Fantastic accommodation to top it all off.If there was one thing that really sold it for me it was that those working at the resort treated you as friends| rather than simply people looking after the area. Lovely community spirit was felt by all.,Milton Keynes| United Kingdom,08-02-15,Yes,5
Excellent choice!,Very nice hotel| very big territory with everything you may need. Located in the least rainy part of the island. Sports| leisure| beach and restaurants a very good. If you are with children| this is the place to go.,Bramhall| United Kingdom,08-02-15,Yes,5
Splendid,Wonderful retreat after hectic 2 weeks in S Africa on safari and touring. The rooms are wonderfully situated around the resort| not your basic hotel block on several floors| but units of 3 or 4 apartments| various distances from the beach and reception. There's two choices of where to breakfast and a further 4 establishments for dinner. (birds are commonly flying about - just saying in case some of you have a phobia with this) The beach is quite lovely and long| but recommend you take some form of footware as broken coral and stones are aplenty under the water and at the waters edge. Also advise taking plenty of mosquito repellents for before and after bites. I have travelled quite extensively but never been bitten as much as in this hotel. Could be the wooden boards under the shower area which never quite drains fully therefore creating a haven for these pesky insects. We arrived just after a cyclone and it rained for 3 of our 7 days and that could have encouraged the mozzies a bit. The rooms are a good size with very comfortable beds and plenty of hanging space for clothes and such they also have huge balconies| which unfortunately are in such a position that the sun never shines on them - so a respite from the sun. Have to say the staff make this place| there is nothing that is too much trouble and they are as happy as their guests. A trip to Grand Bay is good for shopping - we caught the local bus on the street outside and for a few Rs well worth the trip. There is a store within walking distance for any bits you might need. We emptied the fridge in the room and replaced with beer and wine from there (n.b. buying beer & wine from the hotel fridge is the 5 times more expensive than supermarket - just saying lol) Do take very high factor sun protection and a hat too. Oh and a torch or download a light onto your phone| the pathways are not very well lit as you make your way to dinner in the evenings.,Bramhall| United Kingdom,05-02-15,Yes,5
Honeymoon Paradise,I spent my honeymoon at this hotel for about 4 days and enjoyed just about every aspect of it. The well appointed rooms| the excellent external shower| the well kept gardens| the numerous pools by the villas| An excellent Spa. The food was good and fresh.The staff are great| they speak at minimum both French and English very well (like most of the Island)All in all a wonderful experience for our honeymoon| I will definitely return for another holiday.,Nairobi| Kenya,03-02-15,Yes,4
A great beach holiday,I have been to Mauritius a number of times and generally enjoy all the places I have been too. The people are relaxed and friendly and really look after you. The same can be said for this resort. The food at all the restaurants was great but I particularly enjoyed the Indiam restaurant - - the hosts were amazing and took a genuine interest in the guests. The rooms were pretty comfortable but the mosquitoes were quite a problem| they were particularly active and it was quite irritating. The other resorts I have stayed in appeared to have them under control. The only other irritation with the resort is that it is on a very popular (and public) beach. I felt uncomfortable snorkeling far out as they're was a multitude of speedboats driving all over the place pulling people on tubes and I felt unsafe. We were also not blessed with great weather - a cyclone was approaching and it was very wet most days. Still enjoyed it though. The hotel is fairly expensive and we were on half board which was fine but if you are a big drinker you will be taken aback at the prices (if you come from South Africa like we do). The prices are definitely European. The wines selection was also fairly limited in that our first selection was normally not available. I honestly cannot complain too much about the hotel| the room| the staff and the food were all great. Just the weather and mosquitoes were quite challenging,Johannesburg| South Africa,01-02-15,Yes,4
If you wanted Paradise try here,Just come back from a 10 day holiday at Trou aux Biches| if you were setting out to design Paradise this could be a template. Fantastic beach| great food| friendly staff and well designed accommodation. Loads to do| didn't get to see much of Mauritius because enjoying the resort too much- can't wait to go back.,Bordeaux| France,30-01-15,Yes,5
Great place to stay to start honeymoon,My wife and I stayed here for the first part of our honeymoon and were impressed with the service and but thought that the rooms would be closer to the sea - everything good re food and service but we were really looking for X factor service as it was our honeymoon and moved to the Royal Palm which is another hotel of the Beachcomber range which really have us what we wanted - this doesn't mean Trou aux Biches isn't great it is - great golf| great food and great sunbathing.,Woking| United Kingdom,28-01-15,Yes,5
Spectacular,My review is a little late but my husband and I spent the most idyllic11 days at Trou aux biches in September. The room we had was perfect| a beach front villa with everything on the doorstep. I have to say that I found the staff incredibly polite and helpful. In particular we would like to thank Menon at La Caravelle who looked after us as if we were VIP's and also Veema at the Restaurant Booking Desk who was so lovely and helpful. We enjoyed eating at all the restaurants and did not have a bad meal during out whole stay. We loved trying all the watersports on offer and my husband took a particular liking to sailing and went out every day| it was heaven. The Spa is a lovely calming place to unwind| very tranquil. I am finding it difficult to be negative about anything at all and definitely cannot wait to go back.,London| United Kingdom,28-01-15,No,5
5* facilities 3* service - shame!,We have just come back from Trou aux Biches. A beautiful resort. The amenities and activities were first class. The rooms were great| we had a family suite which was perfect for our two boys and us. However the service was poor| the staff were rude and unhelpful| such a shame as the rest of it was perfect.,Guildford| United Kingdom,05-01-15,No,4
Most beautiful holiday resort with lots of sport facilities,Trou aux Biches is situated at the nort eastern part of Mauritius| just before the coral reefs. Appartments| houses| villa's| are designed in a modern way. Staff is friendly and professional. Lots of sport facilities available in the resort| including catamaran stilling and waterski.The various restaurants are very good| One by one| as well as the buffet restaurant!,Oudenbosch| Noord-Brabant| Netherlands,21-12-14,No,5
Repeat performance,This has been our fourth visit to TAB and have difficulty in considering any other place. Our son told his grandma 'he now knows what heaven is like' and I understand where he is coming from. We were there twice on our own and twice with our son (now 11). What is of particular importance is the safe environment enabling him to go off on his own. The food and service is fantastic and the seafront units fantastic. Enough activities to keep everyone busy but with enough down time to rest and rejuvinate. Great holiday!,Johannesburg| South Africa,19-12-14,No,5
call centre service,I have been planning my honeymoon for a few days now and called many hotels in the process (sometimes several times). I practically called Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa for more than 10 times to inquire about different things. So much so that the call centre people have already started to know my name and my query details by heart. I have to say I have been impressed with the way the phone was answered and all my queries| however insignificant| were dealt with. The guy named Rudy in the Call Centre was really professional and patient and ever ready to help. Superb service! Keep it up! I am really looking forward to come spend my honeymoon there.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,17-12-14,No,5
Beautiful and Clean Hotel,We stayed at Trou aux Biches hotel in a beachfront private suite. The welcome at the hotel was amazing| the staff was very nice and the suite was to our expectations. We used the tennis court couple of times and again the people there were very helpful. The different cuisines were all wonderful. We loved the beach and since it was quite hot when we visited| the water was superb.We strongly recommend this hotel.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,16-12-14,No,5
beautiful,I stayed in a beach front suite with pool for 7 nights. I would definitely recommend an upgrade to this room. It was spacious with beautiful views directly on to the clean sandy beach. The bathroom had a huge bath and an indoor and outdoor rainfall shower. The pool was loverly but slightly cold. The hotel facilitates were good. I used the gym and the tennis courts twice and even had a few games of table tennis. I took advantage of the onsite spa and had a relaxing massages after a sauna. The downside was the food| it was average and you had to book days in advance for a restaurant| which we didn't do so we eneded up eating out or ordering room service. Nighty entertainment was your standard hotel entertaniment but we enjoyed it. We ventured out of an evening and went to a fews bars and a club. We also visited the Beachcomber Le Canonnier Hotel where we had friends staying| the hotel was of a lower standard but the food was good.,London| United Kingdom,14-12-14,No,4
simply Perfect,We stayed in May/June 2014 in this beautiful setting| but waited with the comment as we wanted to see the difference in service between the Beachcomber resort in Mauritius and Seychelles (see sep. report)We enjoyed staying in this resort (which is still quite new) and with the full board plus program we knew what the expenses are going to look like. The service was top| the food delicious and the sunset mood from the balcony of our Beach front senior suite with pool also very nice. To point out is the villa layout and the spacious balcony with a swing chair| that transports you into the romantic moment anyone is looking for on vacation| though it is less private but you have the plus of being very close to the beach and the nice beach / palm view plus the sunset experience. The resort is really well taken care o fand is integrated in a beautiful palm-parc.The villa-pool was rather cool and could not be used at nights| but this hight have to do with the Mauritius climate in May/June (cooling up at night) and probabely not having enough direct sunlight on the pool.Beach: lovely long white sandy beach| yet not wide. We definitely enjoyed the complimentary water activties offered by Beachcomber and it was perfectly safe in the clear indian ocean| not deep (but perfect for swimming| canooing or pedalo).We did have quite a lot of beach vendors every day| but it was OK when you politely responded and politely showed your desinterest. The setting and food of both the Thai and the Indian restaurant were great. We also liked the Italian restaurant| but service here was sometimes a little slow.Overall a perfect location really worth coming back. In fact our third visit to Mauritius as there is quite a lot to explore on this island.,Bern| Switzerland,08-12-14,No,4
Heaven on earth,As I told my wife| I had the impression to be in a Disneyworld attraction 'it's a perfect world' for a week. Everything is perfect| from the smallest herb in the garden to the rooms| everybody smiles| says good morning| and the place is incredibely clean| well maintained and managed by a wonderful staff.I am not even talking about the SPA which is probably one of the most beautiful SPA I have seen in my life and the Kids Club which is the equivalent of a 5* Hotel for kids.We were there with our daugther (3) and we all had a great time. We enjoyed many of the amenities and came back very relaxed and happy. There are a lot of activities planned daily and many of them are free| which is also amazing (wakeboard| kayak| snorkeling| etc.). The sport center is also very modern and has all you need to stay fit (and you need to do some sport due to all of the great restaurants they have - special mention for the indian one).The resort is huge and is divided in various 'zones' where you will find the villas/rooms. Each of these zones has a swimming pool as well and you can chill by these swimming pools if you don't want to go to the central place.I can only highly recomment this resort and we will be back for sure!,Zurich| Switzerland,27-11-14,No,5
It grows on you...,"My husband and I are just back from a 10-day stay at this resort.The resort ground are impressive| both in terms of design and maintenance. Rooms are spread in little houses with 3-5 rooms each. These bungalows are grouped in 6 blocks| numbered 100s-600s. Each group is spread around one pool and will have all types of rooms. But of course everyone has access to the beautiful main pool at the center of the resort. Please search for the resort plan| it's very clear. Room layout| even for the cheapest category is fantastic. Everything is big| nice and functional. If you want more details| I would recommend you look at the hotel's website| the information is complete and accurate. Just ask yourself whether you would like and outside shower (tropical junior suites onwards)| whether you would need more space (tropical plus onwards) or whether you would like to be right in front of the beach. But please think about value for money| which I will discuss at the end.The beach is the picture perfect Mauritian beach. It is supposed to be one of the best of the island and| having visited a few| I wouldn't doubt it. Shallow| calm lagoon and powdery white sand. Perfect for swimming even in low tide. During the December-March season you might get some wind from the NW (we got a bit of that in November) in which case the sea might get choppy - but it is also very nice. No need for water shoes| there is little dead coral - although you still need to step with care.The sand stretch in front of blocks 100s-200s is probably the widest and the nicest| and it is also a quieter area. However| due to the proximity of the boathouse| the swimming area will be more narrow and you will have more boats passing by| as well as more (harmless) seaweed. Therefore| if you want the perfect crystal clear sea| you might consider blocks 300s-500s. But note that in high tide you will have little sand and one line of beach chairs (there is more space though inside the hotel ground| behind a line of grass). The beach area in front of the 600s feels very separate from the rest of the hotel and is completely taken over as a public beach (and just next to the main public area). I would not recommend this location.As many reviews mention| the beach is public. This means hawkers and other tourists. The hawkers are really just doing their job and will not bother you if you| politely but firmly| say no. The (non-guest) tourists are a bigger pain. I have been to other dream locations where beaches are also public| such as Seychelles and much of the Caribbean| and never seen anything like this. Even in other parts of Mauritius| in our previous visit| we had never seen such behavior. There must be some kind of game in this part of Mauritius which consists in invading a private resort and ""getting something for free"". While the hotel grounds are large| the beach is long and beautiful with plenty of public areas and even zones with chairs and umbrellas for rent. Some tourists (and locals) will still like to be close to this resort| my guess is that they like the view on the beautiful grounds. Some of them will sit in the sand in front| not bothering anyone. But many others will try to get under the resort ""palapas""| behind or between the chairs| in front of the stairs in the main area. We have even seen people taking hotel loungers. Basically anywhere where there's shade (produced by hotel property) and where they can bother someone else. Then you can see a dance... Between security guards and these tourists| which would move back into the public area after long discussion (we timed it once for 1 hour). I felt very sorry for the security guards| which most of the time did a great job. Of course sometimes they were giving up| or at least for a while...who wouldn't? The issue seems to be that Toru Aux Biches is for some reason attracting this type of disrespectful tourist. I don't mean to generalize but every single time they were French (et oui| France métropolitaine) and most of the time 50+. All of this means that if you want to feel seclusion... go somewhere elseOutstanding points of this resort:- Location and grounds are one of the best in Mauritius| if not the best- Room layout is great| including fantastic shower and very comfy bed- Outstanding concierge - Kodaruth- Smart and friendly beach service - with Dasmuth and Rambo- Very good housekeeping - especially Amrish for the nightly turn down- We were offered a late check out without even asking (and our room was made on the last day so that we would be more comfortable!)In terms of weak points| many reviews criticize service. I would say that service is excellent - except at restaurants. And restaurants are unfortunately the weak point of this resort.- Breakfast is poor (and served ""only""until 10am). We disliked it to the point that we ended up skipping it most days. You would expect a larger choice and better presentation (food is not covered despite the fact that after 9am it starts to be full of flies). The quality of the food| cold cuts in particular| is not top notch. No freshly squeezed orange juice (industrially squeezed maybe but any case not good). And service is almost... catastrophic (with the resort only half full or less!). - Lunch buffet. Quality was there but choice was extremely reduced. We had included in our rate but if we had paid directly for it| I would have been upset. Basically 2 main dishes per day (typically sausages and fish or beef| depending on the day)| plus pizza margherita and pasta. Presentation also left to be desired (many empty stands| probably because the resort was not full| but should be hidden somehow - the structure is not very flexible and seeing half the food stands empty makes it sad). Salads still uncovered (birds were helping themselves). Service was irregular... Some of the waiters were very attentive (Romeo| Somaroo| Kumar)| others seemed lost. One waiter mocked up while speaking in French to a fellow waiter because we ""paid for expensive rooms but only ordered water""... Unfortunately for him we are also French speakers. Fortunately for him| my husband convinced me to ignore the incident rather than killing him. - Dinner. There it gets better| good choice of restaurants| good quality. Dishes themselves correct| but nothing to write home about. Service quite good in general. The main issue was probably the choice of table: tables were attributed first come first served to everyone holding a reservation... So people coming at| let's say| 7pm were getting the tables by the sea front or with the best view and from there they filling the restaurant. No way to book a specific table. Fair enough... Except that in all restaurants we went to| 3-4 of the best tables were systematically kept blocked (""reserved"")| sometimes occupied by other guests later in the evening| sometimes just kept empty for the entire evening (?!?!?). I wonder if they keep them for those who tip more... But in any case| not a very transparent approach. I heard a lady complaining quite loudly about this| personnel seemed embarrassed and they offered a ""good"" table for the next day| but they were checking out. On our end| we got fed up of this and favored room service at the end of our stay. Minor quibbles- No body lotion in the room- Bed sheets are not changed as often as your would expect (and are not given the option of changing them daily)- Seaweed is only cleaned after a few days (so you might put up with the covered shore and ugly picture for a bit longer that you'd like). The only harm is aesthetic ;)Overall| something important to take into consideration in this resort is value for money. In terms of price range| it positions itself as top luxury| at the same level as let's say| the One and Only or Le Prince Maurice. It falls a bit short - but probably shorter if it were at full capacity. The resort is very big and therefore struggles to give you the little personal touches that make real luxury| knowing your name| your taste| not leaving room for my minor quibbles and even less for big complaints. Besides restaurant service| we had a few issues and in every case they were dealt with promptly and efficiently. Most employees are very kind and go out of their way to satisfy your needs| but organizationally| I would say that employees should be better trained to get to know you and anticipate your needs (and of course| fix the serious restaurant issues!).Why do I say it grows on you? Because despite my last comment| if you don't spend a crazy amount of money in this hotel (and feel that for that amount you could experience something flawless)| the place and the kindness of many of its people is unbeatable. And day after day| while your relax| you just feel lucky to be spending your time in this piece of paradise. I hope they invest on certain service improvements and we will return.",Geneva| Switzerland,27-11-14,No,4
A slice of heaven,Beautiful resort| with spacious villas. We loved the outdoor shower and the private pool areas between the villas. An absolutely peaceful and charming resort. A bit of a drive from the main airport we landed at but we enjoyed the drive. Would highly recommend.,Pretoria| Gauteng| South Africa,21-11-14,Yes,5
Fantastic Resort Hotel,We stayed for 10 nights in a beachside suit and our stay really was great. The resort is very family friendly with plenty to do for all the family. The kids club was good with lots of activities and our 3 year old even had a go at water skiing. The resort has a french feel which has a positive effect. Restaurants were good| although not quite gourmet. I would definitely recommend for a family stay.,London,17-11-14,Yes,5
Top end resort on exotic Mauritius,We went to Trou aux Biches| booked by our niece for her wedding ceremony - as she is a travel agent she had previously visited and was rightly impressed.A thoroughly top class beach resort| quite large and spread out along a sandy well maintained private beach. Rooms are well appointed and we had an outside shower.Not very busy despite being October half term there were only a few children about this generally adult resort. Good quality food in all restaurants and a good gym and sports facilities.An excellent place for a wedding and we were not disappointed. Highly recommended.,Berkhamsted| United Kingdom,17-11-14,Yes,4
Everything at Trou Aux Biches is just fantastic!,My husband and I spent 6 days/7 nights at this fabulous resort for my 50th birthday and had such a fantastic time that we are already looking forward to returning there! Our suite was wonderful| the service from all the personnel all over the resort is excellent - so friendly| kind and helpfull. The restaurants and cuisine are fantastic| the spa is exquisite and the beach is lovely! We highly recommend Trou Aux Beach for a wonderful| relaxing experience during which you'll feel very well looked after and pampered!!,Cape Town| South Africa,12-11-14,Yes,5
Beautiful resort,"My family of five (three children| ages six| four| and 17 months) just returned from an eight night stay at this lovely resort. The suites are all very nice. We started off in a family suite| which was very well laid out and also very spacious. I think it's best| though| for families with older children. We found our little ones didn't even use their bathroom| but instead were always in ours (which was huge| by the way| with an outdoor shower). The only downside to this suite was that it was a bit too dark. We were north-facing| so that could have been part of the problem. But we also couldn't use the patio due to mosquitoes (it was always in the shade| too).After a few days| we moved to a senior beach front suite. I should note that this only works out with young children| as they each have to sleep on a sofa| one of which being rather small. But| for a four year old| it was perfect. The baby stayed in a cot in our room. The senior suite is amazing. We loved it.The food at the Thai restaurant was fantastic. We really enjoyed going there. We did not try the Indian| but we did try the rest. I would rate the other restaurants as only so-so. The food was okay| but nothing special. We were on full board plus| which I would not recommend. The buffet lunch was very uninspiring and was not worthwhile. We were there over a shoulder period. The first week| the resort had many more guests and had a much better selection at the buffet restaurant. The following week the place was nearly deserted| and the quality/quantity of food at the buffet restaurant dropped significantly as well. Service at the Italian restaurant was needlessly slow.The kids club had lots of activities and seemed to be very well run. Our children weren't interested in it| though. The predominant language spoken by the children at the club was French (in fact| there was only one other English-speaking child there when we were there)| but the activity leaders all spoke English as well.The beach is wonderful for children| just watch out for the coral. There were some patches of beach that were better than others (i.e.| less coral to step on). The ""beach cart"" could expand its offerings| too. Maybe it's only me| but getting a latte throughout the day proved very difficult. When paying this much money| that shouldn't be too much to ask. Ice cream for the kids also should have been more readily available. Even just ice cream sandwiches in the beach cart would've made a world of difference.Overall| we had a lovely time and would consider returning| but not on full board.",Saro| Sweden,08-11-14,Yes,4
another vote to just book here if you're looking for something special,we stayed here for five nights at the beginning of October 2014 having also stayed at the westin and the maritim. we were looking for some variety and this was easily our favourite of the three. it does come with a high price tag however (particularly the drinks/lunch/dinner) but if you can stretch the overall ambience was really fabulous.the first thing that strikes you is the space here if you think of a golf course (apparently there used to be one here) laid out along the front you'll get an idea of the grounds. there's a generous beach frontage stretching for some 800 yards with sun beds one deep all the way along the sand for hotel guests. the rooms are mostly arranged in blocks of four on two levels and spread out along the length of the property. the rooms are set around a series of smaller swimming pools| the resort didn't feel busy.we loved our entry level room| stylish| modern and functional. food at breakfast was fine and the hotel is within a 12 gbp each way taxi ride of grand baie where we went to the gourmet grill| le rougaille creole and the capitaine for an evening meal (all v.nice)it's easy to also trip out for lunch where if you turn left along the beach and left into the village there are a few places where you can eat| buy provisions| change money| use an atm or get your nails done or arrange tours at a discount to the hotel. (Fabulous mani and pedi London quality apparently at Genna Wellness Lounge.)the main pool in the resort is the best we've seen as was the gym and tennis complex.all in all highly recommended.,london,27-10-14,Yes,5
Perfect holiday destination,My family and I spend three lovely days at this destination| and we enjoyed it sooo much. We were sad to leave. The ambience is sooo private and relaxing. The quality of the accommodation is top class| the staff is very warm and friendly and the choice of top restaurants on site is a cherry on top. Last but not least| the legendary| and energetic Ms Fatima from Customer Relations ensured that our stay was what the doctor ordered. Thanks a million Fatima and the team| my 8 year old daughter cannot wait for our return trip| she thoroughly enjoyed the kids club and the establishment in general.,Amadora| Portugal,24-10-14,Yes,5
Wonderful Honeymoon!,Positive:+ Excelent location;+ Lots of activities included in the package;+ Variety in the type of restaurants;+ Resort style;+ Beach cleaness;+ Service and politeness of the employees| in particular the Guess Relation Manager| Dean;+ Variety of the food;+ Great SPA services;+ Live show in the Indian restaurant by H. Chummun (Rajesh);+ The outside showers in the Tropical Junior Suite Plus.Negative:- Expensive SPA services- Despite of being good| the cleaness of the rooms could be beter- The resourt could be more iluminated| specially the paths between restaurants.Loose notes:The resourt can only be considered to be perfect or near it.Yes| it does have some things to improve| but the overall experience was matching the ocasion| a honeymoon.From everything that we experienced| what comes to hour heads is the amasing beach and sea just in front of the entire resort; everyone kindness| in particular the Guess Relation Manager Dean| that did everything to make our stay perfect; and indian musician H. Chummun| that is a true and kind musician that made us enjoy our meal exactly as if we were in India. We would also like to thank for the quick lesson on the Santoor.'Sara & Hugo,Amadora| Portugal,19-10-14,Yes,5
Very nice hotel,We had a wonderful stay in this hotel. The rooms were very beautiful and clean. The service is very good. Every morning there is a big breakfastbuffet. It's excellent. You can do a lot of activities without paying. The beach is wonderful. One of the most wonderful beach on the island. The location is also good. You can walk from the hotel to the village. Every evening there is some live music. We want to come back!,Zurich| Switzerland,13-10-14,Yes,5
Honeymoon heaven,Had super week 5-star style at the beautiful and efficient Trou Aux Biches. Staff were great: - Rambo who kept our glasses full at the beach - Jennifer who made check in and out a breeze - Rishi and Eshan for keeping our room in tip-top shape 24/7Location and staff amazing - thank you.,Johannesburg| South Africa,12-10-14,Yes,5
Family luxury ,Beautiful surroundings| right on the beach! Kids had a great time at the Bob Marlin club and also with the entertainment and activities provided by the resort. Facilities and services were excellent. Perfect for a romantic retreat. ,Athens| Greece,12-10-14,Yes,4
Excellence!!!!!!,We are almost a week back from our stay in Trou Aux Biches Resort and Spa!We spent there 7 days and I hope we could have stayed more... Fabulous hotel! Better live than in the pictures! Rooms| Gardens| Beach| Restaurant and Services... made our dreams for a perfect honeymoon trip come true. The location is perfect as well. There are things to do outside but the most important is that it offers an easy access to Grand Baei and Port Louis. The staff was very kind and helpfull....The suite (321) was very spacious and clean and near the restaurants| the reception| the beach and everywhere....One of the best hotels I have ever been. The only bad thing was that in case you re in a B&B package there is no way to find out how much the dinner in a restaurant costs. But it was not so important at the end...We recommend it to everyone for honeymoon or even a simple trip....Surely go back again...,Athens| Greece,11-10-14,Yes,5
Designed and detailed to the finest hospitality property,Just back today after spending five days at Troc Aux Biches resort and spa and just fallen in love because of the its detailing to suit children| couple and elderly visitors at the same time. It's not only user friendly but the staff may have been trained to treat the visitors like a family. Wide spread sea front| six restaurants of different cuisine| number of swimming pools of different sizes| sports| kids club| water bodies and the topping of beautiful landscape. Little expensive but recommended to take half board option while booking. Opt for first floor accommodations as per personal or family's requirements. Once is not enough| will love to visit again.,Lucknow| India,07-10-14,Yes,5
Wonderful resort,We loved our stay at Trou aux Biches in July 2014. Rooms are spacious and modern| beach is idyllic and beautiful| with lots of water sports for everyone. Food was good | but could be better. Service in the main restaurants could be quite slow at times.But would highly l\recommend this hotel to friends as we had a absolutely wonderful time there,Perth| Australia,05-10-14,Yes,4
Amazing honeymoon!,We stayed here for a week from 17th September 2014 for our honeymoon.We had a junior suite which was lovely and perfect for us. Spacious and clean.We were on full board. Buffet breakfast - was great with a huge range of choices including a really good egg station. Lunch -Good choice. We did complain on one occasion as we were sat at our table for 15-20 minutes while waiters walked passed smiled at us but then ignored us. This was rectified by the beverage manager where we were invited for lunch at le deck the following day. The food was so much better at le deck for lunch. Shame that's not the same standard at the buffet but it was still good.DinnerBuffet - food was ok. Only had dinner here once.There are Thai| Indian| Italian & seafood restaurants. Our favourites were the Thai & Indian.Thai - gorgeous food!Indian - another of our favourites.Book a few restaurants in one go as they get booked up fast.Beach - this was gorgeous! Only thing to watch out for are the beach hawkers| they can get rather annoying. We found you could get the same products at a much better rate at Port Louis market (Better haggling there). There's a bus about 2mins walk from the hotel into Port Louis which took about 30mins. Not bad for like 33ruppees pp. Also it's nice to experience local transport and get to see more!PoPo supermarket is about 5mins walk.The main pool at this hotel is amazing! The biggest and most beautiful one we have seen. There are also smaller pools in between the suites. We would definitely recommend this hotel!,London| United Kingdom,05-10-14,Yes,5
Superb - just book it!,I could say lots and lots of amazing things about this hotel| I could go on about how polite and skilled the boat staff| restaurant staff and chefs are| I could rave about the very tasty food at every restaurant (especially the buffet) I could delight in sharing pictures of the fabulous sunsets.But im not| trust me this hotel is brilliant| yes we all have our own preferences and dislikes one way or another| but any negatives are so minimal for this hotel that all I will say is that if you have not booked it yet - BOOK IT NOW| and if you have - YOU WILL LOVE IT.Tip - Its on the North west of the island where its warmer and less windy (this is very important when booking in Mauritius| do some research to understand why)Tip - 1/2 bottle of wine = 2 Beers :)Tip - Drinks to buy are expensive| walk 5-10 minutes into the village just off the beach (left if looking at the ocean) buy your mixers| soft drinks and snacks at any local shopTip - Beach hawkers| start very very high| if you do buy| go very very low| and again check the local shops| as they sell everything the hawker has| don't be fooled ;)Tip - If you are not on full or half board there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance or a brief taxi ride.Tip - Take mosquito repellent and be extra cautious around the smaller pools.Tip - Taxis can be booked much cheaper from a Mauritian taxi company and are very good.Tip - Don't bother with your own towels (save the weight) they have loads (and quality ones) and change them all the time.Tip - If you have not booked| look at booking direct| especially honeymooners| they did have some excellent discounts| we saved nearly 2k compared to a package holiday.Tip - Don't worry about booking your beach lounger at 6am| we were getting down there at 9am and there were always plenty left| and we went during peak season.Tip - Relax and Enjoy :),Uttoxeter| United Kingdom,04-10-14,Yes,5
Here you have it,I found it difficult from the reviews to understand what was on offer at Trou Aux Biches so hopefully the following detailed review will help.Overall the hotel is situated in an great location aprox 1hr from the airport and not in the thick of the tourist area but close enough if you want to visit. The hotel and facilities are clean and the grounds are spacious giving you enough to do over the week and not get bored. The only downside I could say is the service is slow| when ordering drinks for breakfast & lunch you could be through your first course before they arrive. All the staff are very pleasant and polite this is the only negative I could think of. Also if you don't like birds then make sure you only dine in the Mahiya or Blue Ginger (which actually are the best food also) as the others are infested with birds flying through and in the daytime sitting on empty tables picking on left overs.Hope the details do not bore you....We booked on a Full Board Plus Honeymoon package for 7 nights| which includes;breakfast- buffet in 2 restaurantslunch- buffet in 2 restaurants with 1/2 bottle water pp and one drink (beer/wine/soft drink)|dinner- any of the 6 restaurants with 1/2 bottle water| 1/2 bottle wine and hot drinks. The restaurants do have supplements for some items on the menu| ie steak was 1200 Rupees.A large range of water sports are on offer complementary to guest| as well as a complete techno gym| cardio room| tennis courts and table tennis.On arriving at 11am we were given an early check in and upgraded to a Junior Tropical plus suite without even asking for any of this. Make sure you book for dinner early as the non-buffet restaurants get fully booked. FOODDinner @ Blue GingerSet menu with 3 tasting starters| soup| 3 mains| dessert and coffees. Lovely variety of flavours| my food was spicy as requested and wife's mild. Service was great but as it got busier felt may have been a little under staffed for the capacity. Breakfast @ L'OrientGood variety buffet inc; omelette| waffle and pancake stations. Full English available as well as cold meats and cereal etc. But these buffets gets boring after a few days.Lunch @ L'OrientBuffet not overly exciting as the variety is less then breakfast and very repetitive. Good to have a free beer to wash it all down though.Dinner @ L'OrientBuffet - we only ate here once as wanted to try all the restaurants on site. There was a variety with some food stands offering freshly cooked meats but was not impressed with the food or time taken to serve drinks. Breakfast & Lunch @ La CaravellaVery similar to L'Orient but on a smaller scaleDinner @ La CaravellaOur first visit we ordered off the menu but found the dishes were not particularly to our liking but on our second visit we went off menu and asked for our own touches. The waiter did not understand us very well but we got there in the end and they delivered what we had asked for. Being our anniversary we asked for a special table which is within a four posted deck (very romantic)| and we were presented with a 'Happy Anniversary' cake with desert. Dinner @ Le DeckWe went for the Lamb Cutlets (should have tried the sea food in hindsight) which were OK. We were sat at the beach front table which was very windy so we asked to move closer in which wasn't a problem| but the service was not great. Again they seem over stretched and we did not receive the attention you would expect for A La Carte dinning.Dinner @ MahiyaSet MenuWe had pre-advised we did not want any meat| so it was nice when the Chef personally came out to discuss my food options| he made a special chana masala which was amazing with egg free nans.Service was great and we wish we had booked here for our anniversary but it was fully bookedDinner @ Il CoralloOption of soup or buffet antipasta for startersSelection of mainsOur waitress was very helpful and friendlyFACILITIESLimo ServiceOffer taxis at set rates and a X5 for longer tours. Our driver VJ was very helpful we took an 8hr tour and customised the places we wanted to visit and paid R5700 but had to pay entry into the Rhumerie and Chameral. We decided not to visit the Chameral due to time constraints as we wanted to visit Port Louis before the markets closed.SpaWe had a complimentary back massage as we had the honeymoon package but you are able to upgrade and use the value against any other treatment. The grounds and facilities are great; Pool| Deck Chairs| Treatment Rooms| Changing rooms with lockers & Showers| Hammam steam room| Sauna. But I'm afraid to say the service from our masseuse's was very unprofessional!! My wife and I were in a room together and from the point of greating us to completing the treatment they were giggling and being childish. It put a bit of a dampener on out day.Boat HouseThe staff at the boat house were amazing| they were very informative on the options available to us and you can see how they support the lesser confident people with the activities. I did water skiing| but the catamaran was the best for me. They normally hold lessons for beginners in the morning but as it was my last day they allowed me to go out in the afternoon. Dillon took me out for a number laps and was a great teacher| something I would highly recommend!!PoolThe pool area did not get that busy during our stay and we were able to leisurely use the pool and the surrounding area| deck chairs do get taken up quickly so you may want to place you towels down early.BeachBeing a public beach anyone can walk along but it was not ever that busy| don’t get me wrong it is not the romantic secluded paradise Island type but not so busy either. The hawkers hardly bother you at all| you get more distractions from the water sport groups offering activities (non-hotel groups). If you are firm in telling them you are not interested they move on without any resisitance. TennisCourts are in good condition and there is always one available. The rackets can be hired free but you have to purchase Balls if you don’t have your ownGymFully fitted techno gym with air conditioning| water and towel. Separate room with cardio equipment and studio with classes.,Birmingham| United Kingdom,03-10-14,Yes,5
Could not have asked for more,This Resort is generally much larger than we would normally choose but we were very impressed with the location| accommodation| facilities and staff. Standard of service superb throughout the Hotel| nothing too much trouble. Lovely beach with crystal clear ocean. Land and water based sport faciliities excellent and all included within the room rate. Good selection of restaurants| particularly the Indian| just make sure you book ahead as always busy. Easy base from which to explore the Island. Would highly recommend Sept / Oct prior to the main season| but this is personal preference only.,China,29-09-14,Yes,5
Family fun,We spend 10 nights here. I've been to many hotels in mauritius this been one of the best. We had kids with us and all thoroughly enjoyed everything about hotel. Great food. Service good in general. Pools amazing. Well done for keeping them all so beautifully clear. Our room even had private pool. Shower huge! Inside and outside. Special thanks to our daily waiter toosly at breakfast. So pleasant and helpful. Dinners around the many restaurants amazing. Only downsides are too many vendors on beach that bother clients all day to sell their goods. Some get rude and reluctant to accept no thanks as a answer. Watch water sports centre| they try use excuses not to take you or your kids at times to water ski etc saying water bad| weather| busy etc but are quick to recommend private expensive boating companies on same beach. Seems for a buck. Other than this perfect. Cheers. We will be back. I'm,Farnham| United Kingdom,29-09-14,Yes,5
Fabulous resort,We have recently returned from a 12 night stay in a 2 bed villa which was amazing - so much space| beautiful bathrooms including an outdoor bath| private garden| plunge pool| barbeque and a great butler. We enjoyed the privacy afforded by the villa which was set back from the beach in a very peaceful location. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and couldn't go to enough trouble for us. The restaurants were great with plenty of variety| the Indian probably being our favourite having tried them all! Trou aux Biches is in a great location on a beautiful beach and an easy drive from places of interest such as Port Louis| the Botanical gardens and Chateau de Labourdonnais. This is a fabulous resort - highly recommended!,Farnham| United Kingdom,25-09-14,No,5
Wonderfull place with very good service,I've been there three weeks for my honeymoon and couldn't expect a better palce : incredible location| perfect room (tropical junior suite)| very nice and helpfull employees and very surprising good food. All restaurants were very good| with special mention for the indian one. I just can recommand this hotel. The only negative point I can notice is the too expensive prices practices for beverage and dishes in supplement in the various restaurants.,Salvan| Switzerland,23-09-14,No,5
Fantastic holiday,Just back from 10 days in trou aux| had an amazing time. Beachfront villas are amazing| so spacious and luxurious. Staff very friendly| Dean especially looked after us very well| making sure our holiday was the best it could be. I would love to return.,Edinburgh| United Kingdom,18-09-14,No,5
Fantastic - would visit again,We stayed for 10 days and loved the place - very spacious grounds and lovely gardens and on the best beach on the island as far as I'm concerned (we drove around most of the island while we were there).The layout is such that they are very private - you don't have anyone facing you. Rooms are also very spacious and well appointed - we had a junior tropical suite with the outdoor shower which was the best part of the suite - didn't bother using the indoor shower at all as it was so nice outside. Room service was outstanding - it seemed as though every time we left the room someone snuck in to make it nice again! Plenty of choices for food but would recommend booking in advance if you intend to eat dinners in the resort - the restaurants fill up fast which just leaves you with the buffet which is great for breakfast but not so good for dinner. The Indian and Italian restaurants were good but if you have a car there are options outside the resort - loved eating from the street vendors on the beach in Grand Baie - a few roti and noodles cost about the equivalent of $5 AUD for the two of us for lunch.We hired a car for the duration through Maki (very good service and much less than Hertz or Europcar) and parking at the resort was free. Service overall was fantastic - nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. Highly recommended.,Perth| Australia,15-09-14,No,5
Relaxing| with Everything,The rooms were fantastic| especially the bathroom - so much space. Service was exceptional and the resort had everything you needed to sit back and enjoy a relaxing break. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful holiday,Karratha| Australia,14-09-14,No,4
Amazing Stay,This was our first time in Mauritius and we decided on staying in the North of the Island for our first 5 days as we had heard the weather in August would be better.The rumours were right| we had sunny hot days with little cloud and rain. The hotel is located on the most amazing beach| soft white sand and clear sea. The hotel itself is faultless| the service| facilities and food and drink were perfect.RestaurantsA good choice of restaurants from buffet to full a la carte. Each restaurant has a unique feel but the overall service and quality in each was the same. We preferred the smaller buffet restaurant though as it felt more intimate than the larger one. Our favourite restaurant was the Thai.Swimming PoolsA choice of pools| one of which was heated| lots of sunbeds and not at all crowded.RoomsWe had a family suite which was perfect for us| the kids had a separate room and bathroom and outside the terrace were beautiful gardens they could play in.WatersportsPlenty on offer and the staff were brilliant| they taught my 12 year old to water ski and they offered 2 trips a day for snorkelling and glass bottom boat.Kids ClubWas large and had everything| they really did take care of the children by keeping them occupied with a range of activitiesTennisThe courts are free but you need to book a day in advance| you get one hour free per day| Racquets are included but you pay for balls| so if you are a tennis person take your own balls as you will save moneySpaOne of the best and most relaxing spas I have been too. Make sure you allow for time to relax in the spa after any treatments as it really is serene and beautiful.The hotel is also close to Grand Baie| approx. 15 minutes in a taxi for around £8,Manchester,10-09-14,No,5
Honeymoon,We stayed in one of the beach front suites| room 103. It was excellent in every respect. The room exceeded our expectations and we absolutely loved the view from the room and the huge huge bathroom. Service and the food at the restaurants (Thai| Italian| International| and Indian) was truly amazing and we made friends with many of the waiters who went out of their way to make the the dinning experience very special. Only criticism was the main buffet restaurant - the food was very average. We highly recommend this hotel. Beach is perfect. Soft white sand. We went at the end of winter so the hotel was fairly quiet (50% full). Overall a wonderful wonderful holiday and would definitely go back!!!!,Johannesburg| South Africa,03-09-14,No,5
Amazing vacations there,We spent 2 weeks of a charming stay. To make it quick: we didn't even find time and will to get out of the resort and tour in Maurice. Everything is made to make you feel special. Beach sports are great| rooms are great. Food is really good and the taff changes the menus everyday so that you can't eat twice the same meal ;) The kids were very happy| up at 10 and back at 8 ... nether seen before. Not asking for Ipad ... In five words: we will come back soon.,London| United Kingdom,03-09-14,No,5
Best family holiday we have ever had!,We spent 2 wks here| returning end August| with 3 kids aged 8-11. It was without doubt the best family holiday experience we have enjoyed. We booked Trou Aux Biches Beachcomber on the advice of a travel agent friend| who told us it was the best part of the island at this time of year (their winter) as it has a sheltered position on the NW corner.We had a 2 bed family suite| which was huge| with 3 bathrooms and an enormous super king sized bed in our room. Linen was spotless and changed daily. It was quiet and private| overlooking a shared pool in the beautiful gardens| a 60 second stroll from the beach and Caravelle restaurant.The beach at Trou Aux Biches is absolutely stunning| a vast expanse of white sand and clear turquoise sea. I took dozens of photos| and i just dont think it would be possible for the beach to look anything other than idyllic. We had a problem finding sunloungers on our first day... On day 2| we were approached by Rishi from the beach crew| who had been tipped off by the general manager as to our moaning (!)| and he asked if we would like beachloungers set up and reserved each day. Which we did!The food everywhere was absolutely fantastic. Our full board plus package meant we could dine at any of the restaurants| with all wine and drinks included. We particularly liked the Indian restaurant| where the staff were just brilliant and even taught the kids how to play the santor (a bit like a sitar). The staff throughout the hotel were really fantastic. They bent over backwards to make our holiday trouble free and relaxing. Fatima| the general manager was very visible around the resort. She heard that one of our children had needed to go to hospital and called me to see how they could assist. They also arranged for a doctor to attend (at our cost| but not an issue).We took several boat trips| bought on the beach. We were lucky enough to swim with wild dolphins| snorkel the lovely reefs| go parasailing| kayaking| paddleboarding| drive a speedboat| take lots of tubing excursions from the beach etc. We also took the local bus to the incredible local market at Port Louis| which was a good way to see local life a little. It costs about 50p each way. There is a lovely fruit and veg market with some local stalls selling delicious Indian food.There is a cashpoint ATM at Trou Aux Biches village| a 5 min walk up the beach. There is also a post office| pharmacy| car rental and spa there too...perfect. The weather was lovely. It rarely dipped below 28 degrees. It rained at night| but only once during the day. It was sunny but not boiling...perfect for children. It was not humid and the mozzies were not too terrible. I got bitten quite a lot but no one else did...a quick trip to the pharmacy sorted out the bites.The beach vendors are mostly very sweet and quite good fun. If you dont wish to buy| just say a firm no thank you. We bought some lovely woven bags| pearl necklaces and 'cashmere' shawls (top quality viscose) and enjoyed haggling. Generally got around 65% off the starting price!This resort has been very cleverly and carefully planned. The grounds are stunning and allow privacy for guests. The beach was so beautiful that we didnt use the resort pools| but they were lovely too. The staff are Mauritian - which sounds silly| but many international resorts import top notch staff from Eastern Europe for the season. They are very kind| hardworking and friendly and make a huge effort to do whatever it takes to give you the best holiday possible. This was our first time in Mauritius and we loved every minute at this incredible resort. Thanks to all the staff for making it a dream holiday.,London| United Kingdom,29-08-14,No,5
An Absolute Gem,I have just returned from a 14 night stay at TAB with my wife| 14 year old son and 12 year old daughter. I echo just about every other comment on here – this place is absolutely wonderful and it was a joy to stay there. The hotel has a beautiful setting and a very relaxed| serene atmosphere. The beach is pristine| and the sea wonderful. It is winter there at present and we took shorty wetsuits in case – but the sea is a glorious temperature and the wetsuits were not necessary| even when snorkelling from a boat out beyond the reef. There is a fantastic infinity pool| and a hotel ‘boat house’ where guests are free to take out kayaks| catamarans| pedelo’s etc. The staff at the boat house are great and will instruct you on how to use the various craft. They will also take you out to the reef on a glass bottomed boat and also on a boat from which you can snorkel. This latter trip is perfect for beginner snorkelers| who might fear to get off the boat in 5m deep water – the staff are incredibly helpful and assist anyone who is nervous. We did it several times| and yes| we were petrified the first time| having never done it before. But we loved it straight away.We had booked a Family Room| but were actually lucky enough to be up-graded to two connecting ‘Ocean View Junior Suites’. These were stunning| with amazing views out onto the ocean| a private outdoor ‘plunge pool’ and an outdoor private shower which frankly is the best shower any of us had ever had. I struggled to get my daughter out of it! Our housekeeper| Lutchmee| was wonderful| and kept the two suites spotless| every day.We were on a Full Board Plus package which meant we could eat huge amounts at lunch and then do the same again at dinner| all washed down with a bottle of wine and soft drinks. The main restaurant provided a buffet| and the menu changed daily. It was perfect for a family and the kids loved the choices on offer. The food was of a very high standard. We always found the staff to be friendly| helpful and very keen to please.We also dined at one of the four other restaurants on site (the Indian) and this frankly was a sublime experience – wonderful service| great food and beautiful surroundings. Utterly perfect.People have commented on here about the beach hawkers being a problem and irritating. I think it depends on how you respond to them – a fairly firm ‘thanks| but I’m not interested’ usually is enough to see them off. If you let them start talking to you| be prepared for a long sales pitch!On three occasions| the hotel surprised me with its service. The first time was when I asked at reception whether it was possible to arrange to see a doctor| as I had a problem with one of my ears. Within 20 minutes| a doctor was in my suite| peering into my ear and then handing me antibiotics and painkillers. Absolutely brilliant service (obviously I had to pay for it| but that is not the point I am making).The second occasion was when we first ate at the hotel’s Indian Restaurant. The Head Waiter came to our table and said ‘One of you is allergic to eggs| I believe?’. We had forgotten that on arrival we had been asked about allergies| and had informed them of my son’s allergy. Anyway| when the Naan bread arrived| my son was given a separate dish of Naan’s| all of which had been specially cooked for him| egg free. This greatly impressed| and thrilled| us.On the third occasion| my wife was having trouble arranging a horse riding excursion with a third party| at a location remote from the hotel. The email correspondence had suddenly stopped and the arrangements appeared to have been forgotten. We asked Jennifer on reception if she could help us| and she went out of her way to call the third party| and calmly sort out the confusion. The next thing we know| my wife and daughter were picked up from reception by a taxi and taken off to the horse riding excursion. Perfect.Their winter weather was ideal| and often pretty hot – I dread to think how hot and humid it must get in their summer! There were mosquito’s| but not many at this time of year| and in any event the suites are equipped with electrical repellents which we found worked very well. There are also cream repellents provided| which worked well too – I only had a half dozen bites over the full two weeks| and usually I get eaten alive. There was very little rain| and when it did rain| it was short lived. It may be winter there| but the sun is still pretty fierce.We found all the staff to be incredibly helpful| caring| courteous| and keen to make sure you were happy. I was amazed at how quickly some of them remembered our room number or our names – this was a lovely touch. The two head waiters at the Indian restaurant were brilliant (to my shame I cannot recall their names). I found the guys who looked after the sports centre to be great: if you like competitive table tennis| there are two very good players indeed in Andy and Jim| and they will be sure to give you a hell of a game! Fatima| one of the senior managers of the hotel| took the time every day to wander around at dinner and speak to the guests| checking they were happy| and we found this to be a lovely touch.The whole hotel complex (and it is pretty big!) feels very safe and secure and we were happy for our children to wander around on their own| even at night - it is all beautifully lit and the place almost has an ‘elvish’ feel about it. If you are remote from the main restaurant| reception and pool area| as we were (we loved being so remote)| you can use the freely available shuttle trolley cars which arrive at your door within minutes of being asked. The evening entertainment is professional and the musicians are of a surprisingly high standard – the drummer in particular stood out for me (I’m a drummer myself!). They don’t play too loudly| and they have an amazing repertoire – on one night they were taking requests from the audience and belting out all manner of pop and rock songs from the past. Very impressive. And if you want peace and quiet| you can easily find it – the music does not boom out across the entire hotel at all.Checking in and checking out was relaxed and straightforward| and there were no surprises with the final bill – other than being amazed at how many milk shakes my kids got through.All in all| I think this is an absolute gem of a place to stay| whether for a family or for couples. We will be returning next year as a family and I am sure that in future years my wife and I will revisit on our own. We all absolutely loved our stay here. Thoroughly recommended.,Leicester| United Kingdom,28-08-14,No,5
Wonderful Family Vacation,A beautiful soft white sand beach with crystal clear water| excellent arrangement for water sports| good hotel property| excellent service| courteous staff with personalized care| nice restaurants with adequate choices - all this made it a perfect place for family vacation.We stayed in their junior suite with outdoor shower. The room was fantastic| very spacious and tastefully done. All the staff together with the hotel manager were very warm. Only few areas where the hotel could improve further| one was the food at the Indian restaurant and also few of the towels provided in the room were not upto the mark (these can be replaced permanently - the hotel staff did replace those for us). The rest was all perfect. I would like to revisit and hope next time we get better rates/deal (say like full board| etc.). I recommend this hotel.,Delhi,25-08-14,No,5
Beautiful place,I have stayed in many good hotels but this one beats the lot it is 5 star plus and has its own private beach with white sand shaded by mature and tall coconut trees.It has been recently rebuilt- within the last 2 years and is a fabulous resort complete with spa|massage| 8 tennis courts and 6 restaurants covering a range of foods including Tai|Indian|European.The best thing about this hotel is the peace and tranquillity you experience especially noticeable at night where you can stroll along the private beach |and it is secure as a number of security guards discretely patrol the grounds| and it is only possible to enter if you show your pass.Restaurants need to be booked for dinner and the Thai one is particularly good with great service.The quality and quantity of food in the main one Oasis which I used for breakfast and some lunches was excellent with a free flow system in operation and it was possible to get food cooked to order by chef e.g. omelets|pancakes|steaks|fish etc. A great variety was available for breakfast eg fresh squeezed juices apple|orange|grapefruit|pancakes|freshly home made marmalade|english breakfast|continental breakfast|fish|sweet cakes|fresh fruit |fresh bread I could go on.Rooms are not like the usual hotel as they are in detached 2 storey villas rather like apartments and the beds are huge 7 foot wide and the most comfortable I have ever seen with fabulous large pillows.LCD TV is available with BBC if you want it and wi fi is free which is handy.Staff are helpful and friendly which is what one expects from this grade of hotel and they come into the room to turn down the beds at night although I don't think this is needed in fact Id rather they didn't come into my room although on reflection there is a device which you can leave on the door outside to say you don't require this service.The shower room and bathroom are open plan well equipped and adjoining the wardrobe with a separate toilet.A minor complaint I had was the towels were rather rough and the lighting in the bedroom was very dark.There was a huge balcony which overlooked a green area and it was useful for drying clothes.The whole complex which houses 800 residents is served by a number of buggies 24/7 which are really useful as the villas could be some distance from reception and at night I found it sometimes difficult to locate my room at the start .This would be a particularly good hotel for a family as it has everything needed included a kids club and the swimming pools are amazing and very safe .Entertainment is available each night and this was mid winter in Mauritius so it was a little quiet although I understand almost all rooms were occupied.,Belfast,21-08-14,No,5
Close to perfect,If you are looking for a brilliant beach hotel for a family holiday then this is it. We stayed at Trou aux Biches for 6 nights in July. This was our first trip to Mauritius and we chose Trou aux Biches after extensive research of hotel and the best location for the time of year. Our safari organiser| Rose at The Luxury Safari Company| easily incorporated this into our safari plans and got us a good deal as well. We were so pleased we chose this hotel. It completely exceeded our expectations right from the start. After the long flight it was a delight to arrive at the brand new airport - a very civilised experience. It was so early in the morning that I hoped but didn't expect our rooms to be ready but they were. The hotel looks fantastic - long beautiful beach| well maintained gardens and really excellent rooms. Cleaning very good and efficient. Hurrah for the free wifi in the rooms which actually worked. We stayed in a family suite and it was excellent - two separate bedrooms|each with bathroom| joined by a hallway which gives a nice feeling of space and separation| plus patio and a lovely outdoor shower. The food was excellent and that includes the buffet - the French influence really shows even in the quality of the bread. We stayed on a full board plus basis which covered soft drinks| beer or wine and coffee with lunch and dinner and was just fine for what we required. Caveat - if you want to drink at the bar then you may be better suited with an all inclusive hotel. Ŵe preferred duty free gin and tonics on our patio so drinks prices weren't a problem for us. As a benchmark| the standard of wine in the full board plus option was around the £7-9 mark in a UK supermarket. Service was spotty at lunchtime when waiting staff seemed overwhelmed but at least you could help yourself at the buffet so you only had to wait for drinks. The hotel manager keeps a close eye on standards and was very visible introducing herself to guests and talking to them about their stay.A special mention for the nurse who runs the clinic attached to the hotel. A small cut needed attention and the reception desk immediately led us to the in-house clinic where an efficient and helpful nurse quickly sorted out the problem| whilst telling us about his nurse training in the UK. A big thank you to him and well done to the hotel for having such an amazing facility - problem solved instead of having to go out looking for a pharmacy and medical centre.Most days were sunny and warm at some points but the sea was too cold for more than quick dips. A beautiful beach though with no shortage of sunbeds. Warmer and sunnier weather would have been better but we didn't mind too much because we were having such a good time. I am sure that the location on the north west had the better weather and we noticed how much worse the weather was on the airport side of the island|We would definitely go again and plan to do so. In theory we are willing to try other hotels in Mauritius but it is hard to move away from a hotel which has delivered to such a high standard across the board.,London| United Kingdom,20-08-14,No,5
A fantastic resort!,We are a family of six and had booked 2 x beachfront suites. Rooms were very spacious| tastefully decorated and had plenty of wardrobe space etc. They were interconnecting which was ideal for us. The room easily accommodates three and the ensuite is amazing. We particularly liked the outdoor shower. We were booked in rooms 503/504 and they had a fantastic deck and plunge pool. We did not use this as much as we would have liked as for most of the day it was in the shade| which was a shame. That said it took 30 seconds to get to the beach and it was an amazing view to wake up to each day.Food was generally very good at all of the restaurants and we were pretty organised and made sure we booked for the next three or four days so were generally able to get the restaurants and times that we wanted. The one area that we felt could have been improved on was the speed with which the drinks arrived. Soft drinks and wine could frequently arrive after the you had started eating your food.A real highlight for us was the variety of water sports on offer - I particularly enjoyed the waterskiing. The staff who managed the water sports were always very helpful and encouraging. There are a few little things that could be improved| but would absolutely have no hesitation in recommending this resort. I really hope at some point we will return!,Amersham,17-08-14,No,5
Amazing resort!!!,"I had an amazing family at this resort in May 2014. The resort is large| and very beautifully decorated| in a very calming| relaxing style. Rooms are very comfortable| with large beds| and modern bathrooms. The beach is long| with soft white sand. The meals were incredible - a very large buffet breakfast| with a variety of sweet and savoury foods. Dinner was also very enjoyable| and we sampled the speciality restaurants| and also enjoyed the variety and huge quantities on offer at the buffet. The service is impecible| and the staff are always there| to say ""yes"" to your every need. My two year old enjoyed playing in the Kids Club| which has good facilities| and care givers| and she enjoyed the large pool area| with dedicated adult and children pool areas. What an amazing family holiday and resort!",Johannesburg| South Africa,12-08-14,No,5
Trou Aux Biches Resort! AMAZING,Trou aux Biches is a great hotel for a business trip| romantic getaway or in my case| a family holiday.Along to the great rooms| the tasty meals and the great facilities| the service is one of the greatest features of the resort. You can tell that the people are willing to help and are happy to assist you. There was one chef in the open buffet who seemed a bit unhappy but I understand people have lives and he may have had a bad day. I would not hold it against the Resort.The transport from airport to the Resort is well organised and the driver was friendly even though we arrived at 11 pm that evening. The dinners were good. The different themed restaurants allows there to be variety in your visit. The variety at the breakfast buffet was also of good standard; Nice choice of breads|meats|yoghurt and even cereal! The food was also tasty and well prepared. I like how the different chefs stand by the different sections in the buffet to answer any questions you have. The room was spacious|comfortable and neat.The rooms offer free WiFi which is a nice touch. The one tap in the bathroom was broken but people arrived at the room to fix it when we called reception to report it. The mini-bar in the bedrooms were well equipped with snacks and drinks. There was a problem with our cards for room-access on the last evening of our stay; I suspect that they were deactivated the evening before we were meant to depart. We hired a taxi through the resort to travel to Port Louis; it was well organised and the taxi arrived quickly. We were greeted by a friendly driver who advised us on places to go in Port Louis. The bar and night-entertainment was nice; The musicians were very talented BUT what made them special was the fact that they had some kind of friendliness and sense of happiness about them| they obviously enjoyed singing and they are obviously doing it for the passion| not the money. I also enjoyed how they accepted song requests from the audience. The resort has a variety of water-sports to choose from which allows for a fun-packed day but if you feel like relaxing| there's a beautiful beach| a large pool and seating under the trees. For ultimate relaxation| there is a spa which offers a variety of relaxing treatments. The gym and teens-entertainment centre are both of high standard and offer a variety of activities. The gym has all sorts of good quality exercise-equipment and there are different classes in the gym every day! There is a business centre for people in need of a computer On the morning of our departure| we were greeted with genuine smiles and a nice little breakfast table to snack off of before our 45 minute trip to the airport which was also well organised. Overall| the quality of our stay was of high standard and I recommend Trou Aux Biches Resort to any family|business person or couple. You will even enjoy it if you decide to take a little well-deserved holiday on your own.,London| United Kingdom,10-08-14,No,5
Wonderful hotel| service needs improvement in areas,I stayed at this resort for just under two weeks and had a relaxing break. Here is the low down;We hired a car from the airport which is about 75 minutes drive to the resort| which proved to be a good move as the taxis from the resort and and any trips are expensive when booked through the agents at the hotel. Mauritius is easy to drive around and places are easy to get to. Grand Baie is 5 minutes in a car which is nice and just outside of town you can find a new shopping mall for essentials.On arrival you go through the security gates however via the beach the hotel is open to locals on the beach and hawkers as it is not fenced off as it is a public beach.I found the check in and front desk staff to be the worse part of the hotel which is why I gave this only 4 stars and not 5. Jennifer who checked us in did not seem interested and was just about bothered enough to tell us about the restaurant booking and nothing else| for example water sports| gym etc which we had to find out ourselves. Further more their is no concierge| just a taxi booking stand so trying to get local information was very poor. Also we had a broken sink which took 4 attempts to report before someone came to fix it properly. All issues were with the front of house staff! You also have to book restaurants in advance| once again| times were booked incorrectly etc. This is defiantly an area for focus.Now on to the good parts.. We were showed to our room which was a junior suite. Very spacious| nice big bed| TV with limited channels and wireless which was free but slow. In door and outdoor shower which was very nice| bath etc| toiletries but no body lotion. The downside was that the open wardrobe was in the bathroom so clothes got damp. The were private pools but these were typical in the shade for some of the day so everyone used the beach. You had clean towels whenever you asked and the housekeeping staff were very nice and helpful. I always left a tip of anywhere between 50 and 100 rupees to say thank you but you did not need to. When you get to know how many locals live you will understand why. Tea and coffee provided and drinks cabinet but we bought our own and used the same fridge which worked out much cheaper.The beach was lovely but water cold in winter. Out of season there were plenty of beds but hearing how busy in season it gets| I am sure this will cause problems so be prepared as not too many beds on the beach. You do get hassled by hawkers but either just saying no or ignoring them they go away| do try to make excuses as we saw others try and it makes it worse. The beach had free water sports| easy to book but also some local companies which charge used the same stretch of beach but they didn't interfere.The gym| fitness classes and cardio room were all well equipped but prepared aircon was not great. Water available with towels etc and snooker/pool for the teenagers with table tennis and 4 tennis courts etc. There was a spa but we did not use and seemed expensive.Now on to the restaurants. Breakfast was either at the main restaurant which was too busy and poor quality food or use the fine dinning| which is a more quiet affair and better quality food although the same food types plus service was nicer.Lunch is again at the fine dining over looking the sea or the deck which we preferred which overlooked the pool and sea. Service slightly better than breakfast and we found the menus changed regularly.At dinner| it was a great service where ever you go except the buffet which seemed to be full of families with children. There was fine dining| Italian| Thai| Indian and the deck which was outdoor eating. Service was excellent and once again whilst we were full board we tipped which the waiters and waitresses seemed to really appreciate. Just remember to book to get your table! We did the full board plus package which included house wine which was very nice and didn't taste cheap at all. Afterwards there was evening entertainment in the bar but the bar was always quiet| sometimes we were the only ones there which meant service all to ourselves but be prepared| apparently on high season it's hard to get a seat. Also at weekends there was some corporate functions| one was ok but one weekend it was MTV and all day we had to listen to bass being pounded out of speakers day and night| this was not great!Overall I would highly recommend this hotel| the overall manager who we met and walked the restaurants every night was very nice and helpful and understanding| just a shame some of her other managers seemed to hide away so you did not know who to talk to when there we some issues. And in addition we spoke to and got to know some of the staff| they seemed very happy working at the hotel and the hotel seemed to treat their staff very well which mad for a happy stay.Its a very nice hotel| not quite 5 star service but the hotel and ground were great| I would recommend it| but go half or full board and expect different levels of service.,London| United Kingdom,09-08-14,No,4
Magic Mauritius,Wow| what can I say other than 5 * all the way :) This property is true paradise... The beaches| swimming pools| accommodation| restaurants| staff and all the other facilities are world class!We were treated like rock stars from start to finish. There is so much to do and the staff are happy to assist to your every need. Thank you to Fatima for your hospitality| Raj at the Thai Restaurant| Leckraj at the Indian Restaurant| Hans at Le Deck| Ashwin and Sadeak at Oasis| Anwar at the Italian Restaurant for looking after us and making our stay and delicious meals so enjoyable and unforgettable :) The Sports guys are fantastic| very well trained and offer fun and exciting aqua aerobics and gym classes daily. The Boat guys are always happy to assist and very knowledgeable. We were lucky enough to stay in 2 types of accommodation| both were very comfortable| beds are awesome| wonderful bathrooms and rooms kept clean| neat and tidy. The beach view rooms are just amazing and we enjoyed our rim flow pool for sundowners :). We hope to be back and can recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a wonderful relaxing holiday with lots of choices of sports and cuisine if required.,Stellenbosch,08-08-14,No,5
Book it!,If you are looking at this note you are probably considering whether you should go to this hotel or not. Well| go and do not hesitate.My husband and I with our two sons in their twenties stayed here in June/ July. The weather| beach| excursions were all perfect| I recommend the quad bike safari. The island is beautiful.The hotel too is perfect| the food delicious| buffet or all a carte from lobster to hamburger| anything you can imagine cooked beautifully. The staff were professional but also very friendly| very caring and couldn't do enough to make our holiday perfect. The rooms were spotless| roomy| luxurious and set in a lovely botanical garden setting each group of villas/ rooms had its own huge pool and then there was also an even bigger one by the restaurants. The beach was so lovely that we didn't use the pools| a lovely sandy beach and reef super for snorkelling. Water sports were free and included water skiing| wake boarding| sailing| pedalloes| canoes| snorkelling and there was even a glass bottomed boat. You could pay extra for parasailing| diving| fishing| swimming with dolphins etc. We traveled to some other beaches but there were not as lovely.Don't hesitate| book it... We are going again.,UK,05-08-14,No,5
Beautiful hotel| shame about the service,This hotel was the final leg of our honeymoon. The hotel is beautiful with a large infinity pool overlooking the sea| smaller pools around the hotel complex a number of different restaurants and beautiful white sandy beaches. The downside for this hotel I think is it is too big| the smaller pools were not cleaned (having bird droppings and animals in the pool)| there was no staff providing free water (I have never been to a 5* hotel in a hot country where water is not offered throughout the day)| there were hawkers on the beach all day meaning you got no peace and then speed boats every other minute. We had a couples massage at the spa which was excellent. The staff where incredibly friendly and the massage was very good| the spa area is beautifully maintained. The reception staff where helpful and always had a smile. The restaurant staff however where horrendous| I have never had such rude service! None of them smiled| said please| thank you| (even after I made a conscious effort to say thank you as often as I could) generally when taking our order the would come and stand next to us| and just say ‘yes’ without looking up! The prices were also astronomical| as there were no other restaurants near us outside of the resort we had little choose but to eat here. It was a shame as it put a damper on the end of our honeymoon. This hotel is more suited to families rather than couples.,Harrogate,05-08-14,No,3
Heaven!,An outstanding hotel! especially for couples and honeymooners.As a honeymooners you get a free lunch at one of the hotel restaurants at your choice and a free massage at the amazing Spa.Everything was excellent: the food was delicious | the service was very good| hotel employees were very polite and friendly| the beach is quite and it is like a photo taken from a screen saver.Highly recommended!,Haifa| Israel,04-08-14,No,5
A beautiful tropical resort,Just spent 10 days at this beautiful resort. We returned after spending our honeymoon there 24 years ago and were not disappointed. Cannot fault the service| accommodation and food provided. From the minute you arrive you are treated with the upmost respect. Every member of staff cannot do enough and nothing is a problem. We stayed in two Beachfront suites with own plunge pool| pure luxury. Our suites were maintained to the highest standard everyday. The food in the buffet was exceptional and different everyday| we did not find it repetitive as some reviews have stated. The staff working in the L'Oasis were polite and very helpful. We read the reviews about booking the other restaurants and were advise at our welcome to the resort as well| we did and experienced all the restaurants each with their own individual style and specialist chefs.The water sports on offer were thoroughly enjoy and safety maintained at all times.The beach and loungers were maintained constantly and the service provided by the Beach car was most welcomed. Yes there are beach hawkers but you get them in every country| they are not a problem and this maybe their only way of earning a living. A polite no thank you is all that is needed. There is always the Beach car personnel looking on and the hawkers have to have a licence so there numbers are limited.Miss Fatima is always on hand and constantly walks the resort over seeing| taking the time to talk to everyone staff and holidaymakers. it was a pleasure meeting her again and sharing our previous visit and discussing the wonderful new resort.This time we took our daughters 18yrs and 22yrs who felt respected by all staff and thoroughly enjoyed all the resort has to offer.Obviously we didn't use the kids club but I would like to express my views on how the staff expertly looked after the children during mealtimes and other activities around the resort. As an Early Years practitioner and Early years lecturer I could see that they cared and looked after every child's individual needs.A truly wonderful stay| thank you to all at Trou aux Biches| regards Family Davies.,London| United Kingdom,30-07-14,No,5
Fantastic resort,We had an absolutely fantastic time at this restort. We went as a family for 1 week and stayed had the senior beach suite with pool as well as a tropical junior suite. The senior suite was amazing with beautiful views of the sea. The staff had made sure the junior suite had been well equipped with baby facilities like a cot e.t.c. The chef personally came to set the food menu for the baby for the week. We were on the full board plus package and really had a marvellous choice of food all through. The chefs at Mahiya Indian and Blue Ginger thai were superb| and since we were all vegeterian| they went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of. All the staff were very friendly and nothing seemed like too much effort. The beach is clean| plenty of water sport options| well equipped gym. Would most definitely highly recommend this escort to anyone| especially those with young families.,London| United Kingdom,28-07-14,No,5
Great location|spacious well appointed hotel,Just returned from this hotel after an 11 night stay. Well located on the north west part of this island so benefits from the best of the weather.Situated on long sandy beach| where there are lots of free water sports and a glass bottomed boat trip.Sun beds comfortable and plenty of them| only annoyance are the hawkers who are constantly walking up and down| they are polite and will leave you alone if you firmly say no but gets a bit wearing saying it every 10 minutes so after day 1 we sat by pool. Sun sets from beach are lovely. There are also other water sports but non hotel boats such as doughnut rides that you pay for.Pool is very close to beach and is of good size with nice shallow surround for small children. We really enjoyed the 11.15 daily aqua aerobics class| it was good fun and well run. Sun beds by pool not as comfortable as on beach | and we in the end swapped some over . Beach towels are provided in room | but they are not long enough so ask for two each.Hotel is extensively laid out and never felt busy even though it was quite full. We had two tropical junior suites. They were spacious and we really loved the outside showers. Each group of rooms also had their own pool which was peaceful to sit by. The grounds are a delight to walk around. We were particularly impressed with how clean everything was and the level of housekeeping in the rooms. If you want to tip your room valet | give it to them yourself day before you leave !Food was good and the various restaurants provided good variety. Would recommend you email and book the first few as the Indian is popular and not very big if you like Indian. We enjoyed them all bar one which was the Italian where we didn't think food and service as good as the others. Particular mention goes to Menon in La Caravelle- thank you for a lovely special meal.The main buffets were good quality and we ate there some nights too. We were on full board plus and found that great| house wine certainly was good. Each night the manager walked around each restaurant to speak to guests which was a nice touch.The bar was a bit fresh to sit in and they could do with providing blankets for the knees in the evening during the winter months- enjoyed the musicians and entertainment .Spa facilities were excellent and have a very relaxing atmosphere | can recommend Ali for reflexology and Thai massage . Tennis courts were good| there are 6 of them. You can only book on the day and are very popular between 5 and 7pm so you have to remember to ring and book. Gym facilities also good.Great for families or couples as it is so spread out you can find your own quiet spot. Staff are all very friendly and courteous .,Birmingham| United Kingdom,28-07-14,No,5
Not for us,We were looking forward to Trou aux Biches for my 50th birthday after a good recommendation from a well travelled friend. However| whether the expectations were too high or not| we did not enjoy the hotel very much. The hotel in itself is very pretty on a nice beach| and the staff are more than happy to help. But it is very focused on family and buffet style eating| and the other restaurants do not sit many guests so imperative to book. The Italian restaurant was the best by far from all the others.Good things: All food is fantastic| although repetitive in the buffetStaff very nice and nothing too much troubleRooms (we had tropical junior suite) are spacious and cleanThings we did not enjoy:Too many children - they were everywhereToo many hawkers on the beachToo many water sports craft in the water| it was not safe to swimToo many sun beds| gave the appearance of some Spanish beach and not a beautiful resort in MauritiusBuffet buffet buffetInsects (of course) but no mosquito or insect repellent provided in room so you could not sit on the balcony without being bit to death.No international plug for australian plugs (first hotel in the world that has not had this)Would i go again| no way.,Brisbane| Australia,23-07-14,No,3
Fantastic location for a wedding,This is definitely a 5star holiday! Lots on offer at the hotel from sports activities to spa and relaxation. The beach is lovely with plenty of sun beds and waited on hand and foot where every you go. Swimming pools are lovely and food top quality. Lots of free activities too!If you are looking for somewhere to have a wedding this is the place to choose| location perfect| photographer excellent catching the sunset as well as the perfect beach pictures. Fiona our personal wedding planner was excellent she took all the stress out of the wedding we didn't have to worry about a thing. It was a beautiful ceremony. They sorted all the legal paper work taking us to sign the papers and the taxi driver even sorted out us getting an extra copy of our wedding certificate. The easiest way to get married beautiful location. This hotel is also used for families and offers children's clubs but can't comment on these as we went as a couple.,Wigan| United Kingdom,21-07-14,Yes,5
Fantastic family holiday,This is the second time we have stayed at Trou Aux Biches| and the hotel remains an excellent choice for a perfect family holiday. We strongly recommend the Family Suite| which has substantial accommodation including a seperate twin bedroom and bathroom for the kids| and a huge bedroom and ensuite (with outdoor shower) for the adults. A ground floor suite works well as the terrace opens up onto a communal garden with swiming pool. The restaurants have maintained their usual high standard| with an excellent choice of cuisine. We would also praise the staff and facilities of the Kids Club| who organised all activities in a fun but creative way - our two would have been happy to stay there for the whole time. The location on the beach is fabulous| with the potential to move off site very easily if desired| and we would also particularly recommend the restaurant 'Pescatore' which is located 10 mins walk along the beach towards Mon Choisi.We would definitely visit again| and thank you to all the staff for making our holiday so good.,London| United Kingdom,21-07-14,Yes,5
An amazing place to be,Our family spent the past week at the resort| which we found to be absolutely amazing. We arrived quite late on the Sunday evening| and were greeted like stars at the reception area. We were taken to our suite by club car| and to our family ground suite was spacious and luxurious. We also had a lovely late supper laid out for us in the room. It was the world cup final| Germany vs Argentina| so we went off to the L' Oasis bar area and watched the second half on the big screen. The whole resort has so much to do and we did not see a lot of our children| after the 1st day. The Ladies at the Bob Marlin Kids Club were excellent| our daughter had a lot of fun| with loads of activities planned| for each day. We also booked at all the restaurants| and all the food| was delicious| especially the Indian and Thai restaurant. The waiters are very attentive and helpful. The breakfast buffet at L'Oasis| was substantial and tasty. Loads of water sports and great swimming pools| especially the main pool| where there are fun water aerobics each morning| after 11am. We had loads of fun| and great live entertainment| in the evenings| from local musicians. Super Gym area with options of classes| each day| like Yoga and T'Chi.,Cape Town,21-07-14,Yes,5
Awesome property!!,I stayed there for 1 day| but I wish I could have stayed more. A place to spoil yourself. Nice beach| so many water sports activities| a big main pool| luxurious room....everything contributing to the great pics!!The only think which I was not happy about is food @ multi cuisine restaurant| maybe coz we are veg! But a must stay for travelers to Mauritius.,London| United Kingdom,19-07-14,Yes,5
Good service and great location,We stayed at Trou aux Biches in the december 2013 holiday period for a period of 12 days.Accomodation and suites are very good. Combination of boat house close to main center of the hotel is good. Central pool and activities such as sailing| kayak| waterski| windsurf are close by. Service mindedness of staff is very good. At the same time sufficiently personal but not too much.Restaurants and food is good and there is ample choice of menus and types of cuisine.Evening bar was I found the least of the qualities.A place to return to as do many of the guests.,London| United Kingdom,18-07-14,Yes,4
Good but not great,We had a mixed experience at Trou aux Biches. If you are looking for a mid-upper level family hotel and a lovely pool/beach then this is for you| if you are looking for luxury then I would look elsewhere. PositivesThe staff were generally very friendly| especially on the reception desk. The beach was beautiful| there were plenty of sun loungers and it was very clean. The main pool area was also lovely| and a good size| so even at capacity I imagine it wouldn’t feel too overcrowded| and The Deck café next to the pool was nice. There are a good range of restaurants| and the food was generally very good| Il Corallo (Italian) was our personal favourite. The atmosphere at the restaurants was lovely| they are surrounded by water and candlelight with live music...the perfect holiday atmosphere!NegativesThe room was large and airy but with low quality finishes| the bedding and towels were not the quality I would expect from a 5*. There was no beach bar or area to get water/ice cream| etc| and you had to take towels down to the beach with you rather than having someone based there with fresh towels| as other 5* hotels do. The semi-private pools were a nice touch but showing a bit of wear and tear| there were also a lot of fallen leaves in and around the pool that needed cleaning up| it felt a bit neglected. At the buffet there was a huge selection of food to please everyone| but of average quality and they seemed to be understaffed as service was very slow for breakfast and dinner. There were a few activities available but no one seemed to be organising them| my husband went to play in a tennis tournament but no one was there| and no staff were around to help. We did enjoy our trip| and although we would not go back| we would recommend this hotel to families.,London| United Kingdom,17-07-14,Yes,3
Best hotel in Mauritius,This is day 5 of our stay at Beachcomber Trou aux Biche and I can honestly say that it is the best hotel we have stayed at in Mauritius. Previous years we have stayed at Sugar Beach| Le Victoria| Heritage Le Telfair and Le Paradis but this hotel wins hands down. It is a huge hotel and is fully booked at the moment yet you don't feel the volume of people. The only tell tale sign is that service can be slow and frustrating in the restaurants| but that seems to be a problem everywhere in Mauritius. The gardens are enormous and beautifully manicured. We are in a beach villa on the far right of the hotel which is much quieter part of the property. Our room (101) has an unbroken view of the beach and we have watched the most beautiful sunsets from our verandah. We are on the all inclusive package which gives us access to all the restaurants (6 in total). This is a huge plus point as one isn't limited to the main restaurant as so often happens. The drinks option on the all inclusive is very limited however and the hotel is extremely expensive. So go all inclusive if you have the option. The sea is unaffected by the tide which means that there is deep water to swim in at anytime. This isn't something that you find everywhere on the island| and if you love swimming and cooling off this is a huge bonus. The weather in July is definitely the coolest we've experienced on the island. We usually come in August or September| however it is by no means cold. You may need something warmer in the evenings but the days are balmy and much warmer than home (Cape Town) at the moment. We will definitely be back!,Cape Town| South Africa,16-07-14,Yes,5
Amazing choice of restaurants and great beach!,I stayed at this hotel with my husband for a romantic break away in the beachfront pool suite. We weren't disappointed. The rooms were great and location by the beach was lovely. We booked with Seymauritius who were knowledgeable and helpful throughout the whole process. All their advice lived up to expectations. They even gave us useful trips for where to go if we did want to venture out of the hotel. The FBplus offer we got at the hotel was great as drinks increase the cost of holidays like this. As I said in the title too the restaurant choice at the hotel was really good too. A great deal we thought and well worth a visit.,Birmingham| United Kingdom,14-07-14,No,4
Best Luxury in North! Excellent Services!,I believe its the best hotel in the north of Mauritius. The services are just excellent & up to the mark. Great place to enjoy| relax & chill! Best part is the long beach that they have & the boat house facilities are super! Just need to focus a little on the Indian food and it will attract lot of Indians! Had the most memorable stay.,Mumbai| India,11-07-14,No,5
Super Hotel,It was our 2nd time in Mauritius & I was so happy that I choose this hotel to stay. The property is just brilliant. The staff is extremely courteous. Right from our check-in to check-out was very smooth. At check-in we were explained everything about the resort in detail. The rooms are very spacious & well done. The location of the hotel is brilliant. The sunset view from the beach is breathtaking. The swimming pool is very well designed & big. The water sports offered by the hotel are great. They do have locals offering different water sports too & they were good too. The shop at the hotel also offers some great buys.My travel agent in India through their counterpart in Mauritius got us a free upgrade from half board to full board. If you spend most of the time at the hotel then you must go full board & in case you like to explore outside the hotel then go for half board. Rather since we had missed our lunches on 2 days| the resort allowed us to use our lunch on check-out day. A la carte is expensive & would still recommend full board| even if you can have half the lunch meals at the hotel. Would recommend you book your dinner meals the moment you check-in since they go very fast & you would be left with eating in the common restaurant. Rachael was very courteous when on our request she went out of way to get us one of the specially restaurant for dinner on the last evening of our stay. Fatima the main person behind successful running of the resort was very courteous to meet & greet all the residents at some time or the other. One of the evenings was a complimentary cocktail evening for all the residents & the bar was beautifully done up. Their was a saxophone player & lovely cocktails to sip. Its a brilliant property & is highly recommend.,Delhi,04-07-14,No,5
Wonderful wedding and honeymoon venue,We are so pleased that we chose Trou Aux Biches as our wedding and honeymoon resort. The arrangements were faultless and so personal. It is difficult to imagine a more romantic setting| acres of beautifully planted and landscaped gardens with beautiful private beach. 6 excellent restaurants to chose from| all proving great service as well as great food. Our wedding planner| Virginnie was amazing and couldn't do enough for us| we were made to feel so very special. Facilities| water sports and spa all superb. Holiday booked through janek@travel-pa who provided a really personal service| is so knowledgeable and gave us the best possible prices| will definitely book again!,Langport| United Kingdom,01-07-14,No,5
Beautiful place to stay. Luxury and family friendly.,"It's our second time in Mauritius and first time at this hotel.The staff are extremely helpful and can't do enough for you. Especially with our daughter. The accommodation is of high quality| clean and very comfortable. We stayed in a tropical junior suite plus.We have a 2.5 year old daughter and she made lots of friends with many others young families. The beaches and pools are great for the little ones. Beautiful clean golden sand and large shallow areas in the pools for them to play.There are many people trawling the beach trying to sell trinkets and bags. Also people selling boat trips. This can get a little tiring at times but most are polite and leave you alone after saying no thank you. Sitting by the pool avoids this as the security guards seem to prevent them entering onto the hotel property. But don't let this put you off using the beach.Hotel has great water sports facilities which are included. We used the glass bottom boat and pedalo's but there are more things like windsurfing and sailing.The quality of the food is good in the main restaurant but it's worth reserving in the other ones for variety. We found we had to reserve a day or two in advance.We booked B and B only with an online travel site. But a quick call to the hotel suggested we could upgrade to half board for a reasonable amount. Child free. When we arrived we paid this and we're upgraded to ""full board plus"". If you don't want to leave the hotel then it's a worthwhile option as you get breakfast lunch and dinner with some drinks. Lunch and dinner you get 1/2 bottle water per person and 1 drink which can be 1/2 bottle wine| 1 soft drink or beer etc. it's plenty for the meal then you just need to worry about your evening bar drinks. You can eat in all restaurants with this| one or two items on the menus require a supplement payment but it's clearly marked on the menu.Overall we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel.",Pontypridd| United Kingdom,29-06-14,No,5
wonderful,We have just arrived home after spending two weeks here. The weather for winter was very good| warm| mostly sunny and very little rain. We sat outside for dinner everynight and only wore summer clothes. It is hard to know what to add as there are so many reviews| but we found this place hard to fault. The staff without exception were polite and helpful.I have read other reviews complaining about the beach being public and the hawkers| but if you do your research and this is going to bother you it would be better to go elsewhere. We found the hawkers to be friendly and not aggressive| and you can also get a good cheap massage on the beach.The food was fresh and good quality| occasionally the food in the buffet was not hot enough| but the dessert buffet was the best we have had anywhere|We had a Junior suite and really liked it being upstairs as the balcony was private and you could leave the door open for fresh air. They do not supply body lotion| and the water is undrinkable and tastes awful in coffee| but it is only a short walk to several supermarkets for cheap bottled water to fill the jug| There are also fantastic patisseries a short walk if you haven't already eaten enough.The walk from our room to the main restaurants took several minutes| but the beauty of it will stay with us always. Would love to think we might get back to this exceptional place one day.,Melbourne| Australia,24-06-14,No,5
Paradise Honeymoon experience,We stayed at the resort for 2 weeks and the whole experience was fantastic from start to finish.The staff are very helpful and professional at all times| nothing is problem and they are so friendly and welcoming. The grounds are beautiful and picture esque as soon as you arrive at reception all the way through to your room everything has the highest amount of detail an attention.We stayed in a junior tropical suite and the room size is plenty| it's very clean and has the highest finish furnishings an mod cons. The only draw back was wifi speed was slow but usable to do the basics.The pool and beach are the best on the island truly amazing and the free watersports keep you from being bored. We also used the gym facilities often and attended classes and was impressed with the facilities and with the staff taking classes. The equipment is again the best as are the tennis courts.The spa is amongst the best I have experienced and I have attended many spas due to work. This really left me and me wife floating we upgraded our free massage to a 2hr treatment.We went half board with honeymoon lunches| the food was fresh and tasteful with plenty of options. The Indian restaurant is my recommendation as it was a delight.We had some issues during our stay and they were handled with the best customer service possible we even got a room upgrade to the biggest suite possible and the design and space of the room added to the luxury we experienced over the 2 weeks.If there are any draw backs it's that's we didn't get round to all the restaurants due to the bookings procedures.You won't regret staying here.,London| United Kingdom,20-06-14,No,5
Holiday of a lifetime,My husband and I travelled with 2 other couples to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary and can't speak highly enough of our entire experience! We had a junior suite and our friends originally had a 2 bedroom suite (as 3 bedroom suites unavailable at time of booking)| however when they checked in they were upgraded! The villa was unbelievable!! The third bedroom had single beds| but more than adequate with own ensuite| so we had a couple of sleep overs during the week. The service and attention to detail is second to none| food incredible| facilities excellent| really not one thing can be faulted! We were greeted at the airport by White Sands company for transfer to resort then had appointment the following day to book tours etc. We went Sailing With the Dolphins; City Highlights and Casella Park| Walk with the Lions! Amazing value for money and once again| service incredible with the staff all going to extremes to ensure we all had a wonderful time!! Mauritius has so much to offer that 7 nights were just not long enough so we have promised ourselves return trip to enjoy the rest of the island!!,Bundaberg| Australia,18-06-14,No,5
Absolutely Incredible,The Short: This place is paradise| and the food is fantastic. We stayed here for our honeymoon for 7 nights and we were in absolute heaven! I'd recommend this in a heart beat| to anyone.The Long: I'd never been to Mauritius before. When I was trying to choose a honeymoon destination| loads of people said I should avoid Mauritius. I can easily say that| either those people haven't stayed in a place like Trou Aux Biches| or they're mad| because it was unbelievably awesome! Mauritius is beautiful - full of green sugar cane fields and mountains| and of course| incredible blue water. That said| while we did leave the resort to go to Grand Baie| I wouldn't recommend it - the towns and villages are mostly run down and have nothing interesting to see. But they're way way better than the villages of Thailand. They're cleaner and friendlier for sure.The actual resort is mindbogglingly awesome. It's HUGE and while the design is magnificent| the natural vegetation they've built around| is beautiful. Unlike a lot of resorts| Trou Aux Biches has plenty of space - something I was looking for.The rooms are great - big| spacious| and luxurious. We stayed in room 641 (right at the end to the left| if you're looking at the sea) - a junior garden suite. We actually preferred not being right on the beach as it was quiet and secluded and really only a 1 minute walk to the beach anyway. The food is out of this world. 6 restaurants (Thai| Indian| Seafood| Main Buffet| Italian| and International) means your palate doesn't get bored! You do have to make bookings at these restaurants though| and not all of them are open every night - the seafood place| called Le Deck| was only open on Friday and Sunday| and Friday was a pay-for lobster evening which we didn't opt for| so we never got to enjoy it - a bit disappointing - but overall| we walked away full and content everyday.The beach is white and about 2km long. The water is incredibly blue and there really is just nothing like sunbathing and swimming on a beautiful beach.The spa is also wonderful| but it's ridiculously expensive. However| we found a great spa just opposite the Trou Aux Biches police station that was much cheaper and so we did that instead. We also made a trip to Super U (a massive supermarket in Grand Baie) where I bought Phoenix Beer for 30 rupees a can instead of paying 240 rupees a can from the mini-bar in the room - win! :)All in all| it was an outstanding stay. We'll never forget it and will always be incredibly blessed to have been able to stay in a place such as this.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,18-06-14,No,5
Excellent beach and good location,We stayed 4 days in this hotel and I wish it could have been at least the whole week. The reception is incredible| tropical decoration| sleek lines| vegetation and water features. We were received with a small cocktail and fruit. We were booked a standard suite but got upgraded to a tropical suite| which is the same but the latter features a shower in the garden which made me fall in love with the room. The tropical suite is spacious| with sitting area and terrace with table| chairs and lounges. The bed is big and comfortable and there is a desk area. The bathroom features a walk in wardrobe with iron facilities and plenty of space for all your stuff. Private WC| a bath| a shower and access to a small private garden with an outdoor shower. The hotel premises are huge and golf caddies are needed to move around| you can walk but if you call for one it will be there within minutes. The hotel is really looked after| there is lots of gardens| everything is spotless. We did not have all inclusive just B&B| the breakfast was very good and we had lunch twice in one of the restaurants were they cook in front of you| once we had chinese noodles| the other time we had Indian curry| delicious! Trou aux Biches is a short cab ride to Grand Baie so you can have a meal outside| we went in low season and the restaurants and bars were a bit empty but we found The Beach House| for food and drinks and we really enjoy it there. One of the main points of this hotel is the beach| it is incredible... and they have plenty of free water sports that will keep you entertained for days. You have the bus stop just outside to go towards Grand Baie or Port Louis| a lot of tourist use the bus and they are very frequent. Finally the staff| they all get to know you and acknowledge you and care about you| we were not there for so long but all the people we met always greeted us and knew who we were. They were very helpful. The day before we left they called us| they wanted to know what time it was our plane| it was at 6.30 pm| they gave us a late check out for free| how nice! I totally recommend this hotel and Mauritius as a destination| specially if you like relaxation.,New York City| New York,17-06-14,No,5
Simply superb,Must thank the Hotel for making our holiday a perfect one. great property| suites are just wonderful| well maintained| spacious| and much more than what we had expected. Very friendly and considerate staff| always ready to help| immediate follow-up for all queries and needs. There was a personal touch in all the services offered by the hotel. Lots of beach activities| long 1-km beach just makes the place out of the world| The main infinity pool was also well designed.My son got hurt at the hotel| and the hotel nurse immediately attended to the issue| was impressed to see the medical facilities at the hotel.Weather in June was a good time for a holiday here| specially coming form a hot place like India - temperatures around 20 degrees Celsius and no humidity.,New Delhi| India,15-06-14,Yes,5
Great Holiday,Just returned from Trou aux Biches In Mauritius.This is our 3rd stay at this wonderful resort| where the facilities and service are excellent.On this occasion our daughter| son in law and our 2 small grandsons joined us. Kids club was a great success. We look forward to returning there in the not too distant future. Jenny and Rolf,Melbourne| Australia,12-06-14,Yes,5
Romantic hotel 5*+,A perfect honeymoon destination with wonderful service| calm| yet plenty to do.Rooms : simply amazing - lots of space and not too far away from the reception| restaurants| spa and beachBeach : people come to the Trou aux Biches beach because it is so beautiful. Very safe too.Water activities : free with the hotel - snorkling| fishing| pedalo| glass-bottom boatStaff: extremely friendly and polite.Food : it was like going out to a restaurant every night. Wonderful food in all the restaurants. Accessible to all| even veggies.Excusions : with Summer times with did the Exotic North trip which was worthwhile with a visit to the sugar factory| the capital (not much to see here)| Cap Malheureux with a pretty church and the Pamplemousse botanical gardens. Worth doing thanks to the guides explanations.The paradise Island trip was less worthwhile with only 3 hours on the island after having picked up other guests from others hotels in the area before driving 1h30 to get a boat to Ile aux Cerfs. On the beach at Trou aux Biches| it's perhaps worth asking one of the local guys to take you in his private boat for more flexibility| less travel and a cheaper cost. (Gaëtan seemed really friendly and offered swimming with dolphins activities and visits to Ile Plate and Ile Gabriel).Our only regret overall : not staying longer! We highly recommend this hotel for couples and the hotel has some lovely gestures for honeymooners.,Milano,11-06-14,Yes,5
Fantastic pool!,The amenities and rooms of the hotel are beautiful. The main pool is very well design| and the view is astonishing. Also| there is a smaller pool that you share with a number of other guests that are staying near your room| which are quieter (very nice to swim). The beach is not so good| quite small. But the sea is warm and nice. Try water skying! The food is not top quality. Just ok. They should improve the quality.The room is very comfortable. We had one with a shower outside| which was really nice.We were not not lucky with the weather| but I guess the weather is not so great in Mauritius...Overall I would recommend this hotel.,Milano,10-06-14,Yes,4

Good but not great,"If you're looking for a place to stay and not worry about anything around (consider here $) this is a good choice. For me and my wife| who love to explore nice restaurants around| this is not the best choice. We chose the bed and breakfast option| already taking into account that we'd have many options of restaurants around. The thing is: it's not that easy to get out of the hotel and taxi prices are quite abusive (tip: Google for ""taxi mauritius"" once you're there| avoid using taxi provided by hotel). The hotel has about 6 options of restaurants - we've only tried one ""Le Deck"" - about USD100 per person for a not that good food (wouldn't recommend it at all). The beach is very nice - try at least one of hotel's water activities (many of which are ""free""). Overall: good but not great - would only recommend if price is much better than other options.",Sao Paulo| SP,08-06-14,Yes,3
Romantic resort,We went for our honeymoon end of May 2014 with toddler (its a long story) of 3 1/2The whole atmosphere of the place is designed to put you at ease and make your stay as relaxing as possible The food is fantastic. I wouldn't recommend going full board as although drinks with meals or on the beach are expensive by UK or local standards the buffet on offer for half board is of such good quality and variety| we only went to the specialist restaurants once. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The beach is perfect. The sports facilities ample and watersport especially so. Local car hire is ok| but travelling on roads other than the motorways very slow by UK standards. We would really love to go back as soon as possible!,derby,03-06-14,Yes,5
Truly Wonderful Stay,My boyfriend and I stayed at Trou aux Biches for a two week stay| booked for us by SeyMauritius in July 2013| and we had an absolutely wonderful stay.The hotel is beautiful| the location is absolutely perfect| the beach was stunning| the watersports options varied and great fun and the sunsets perhaps our favourite of any of the holidays we have been on recently and the icing on the cake is the customer service and attention to detail. There are 6 restaurants on the resort which are all fabulous - our favourite was the fine dining option but it totally depends on your personal choice...We really hope to come back and visit soon perhaps as part of a multi site holiday and would definitely recommend this hotel. xo,derby,02-06-14,No,5
We will definitely return,"We just returned from a family holiday with 2 kids (14 & 4 yrs old) and had amazing time at this gorgeous resort. As others mentioned| the grounds are amazing| beach is one of best we have experienced (lagoon| white sands and so well suited for younger kids)| service is excellent| rooms are extremely well appointed (highlight is the shower in tropical suite plus category we stayed in). Hotel staff was extremely accommodating with all our requests (one in particular - early check in) as arrived in the resort just after 8am| room ready for us to settle in and start our vacation. We opted for half board as this suited our needs and have booked each night's dinner at different restaurants| some a la carte and some buffets. The breakfast is plentiful and dinners prepared to a high standard. The only comment we would have is that we really enjoyed the Mauritian Buffet and would have loved to see local Mauritian dishes as a part of the ""International buffets"". The hotel offers fantastic array of water sports and activities to keep everyone happy which is great if travelling with teenagers. The pools and surrounding areas are great. Teens and kids clubs really well equipped to keep the kids entertained. Only drawback is that you will get pool towels in your room and having to carry them around all day when changing pool for beach locations and back to your room every afternoon is not ideal. Other than this the whole experience in this resort was one we will remember for a very long time and we are looking forward to coming back at some point in future. The staff is excellent and extremely courteous and Fatima| the hotel GM is always around during the day and evenings and makes conscious effort to speak to as many hotel guests as possible personally.",London| United Kingdom,02-06-14,No,5
“COLOSSAL PROPERTY FINE SERVICE”,We stayed at Trou Aux Biches resort from 17 may to 23 May 2014. We were in a group of 13 family members along with two infants. Positives:-• Huge sounds a small word for the property as it spread well across area of 35 hectares. The moment you step inside you feel rejuvenated. • We stayed in Room no 202 which was a tropical junior suite plus category room. It was pretty big with all modern amenities and an attached open bathing space. • The staff is excellent and extremely courteous. They go all the way to serve any of the needs.• Special mention about Chef Rathod at the Mahiya restaurant| since we were vegetarians he went out of the way to make us happy. Ouma at La Caravelle was very good in her service. • Kids club was excellent; My 1.5 year old son had a blast there. Negatives:-• Buffet breakfast spread was little disappointing| as were expecting a bigger and better spread.• Jenny at the check in counter was rude and arrogant in her behavior. Only staff member who was extremely disappointing. Overall:-After doing a lot of research I had finalized this hotel and was very happy with my decision. I recommend this property as one of the best in Mauritius.,Mumbai| India,31-05-14,No,5
We will be back,My boyfriend and I stayed at Trou aux Biches two weeks in july 2013| and we absolutely loved it!The hotel itself (atmosphere| design etc.) and the location was brilliant. The beach were absolutely amazing and the sunset breathtaking. We had half board that included breakfast and dinner at the Hotels 6 restaurants. Breakfast was good and the restaurants even better! Our favorites were fine dining and the indian restaurant. One of the first days we picked up some water and musli at the supermarket down the road| incase we just wanted to relax at the room for lunch. We also had water sports in the package and we used the pedalos| water skis and wake board several days. Beds were great and we slept well.What really made our stay was the staff. We especially want to thank mr. Rambo at the beach. As a biologist he took us for a sightseeing on the hotel grounds and gardens showing us all the different flowers and trees. He gave us good advices for what to do on the island and how to do it :)We hope to come back soon and would definitely recommend this hotel!,Oslo| Norway,29-05-14,No,5
Amazing,We went on our honeymoon on the 6th May for 2 weeks with a 1 year old and had a Junior Suite. The welcome was amazing| fruit skewers and a cocktail and cold towels. The room was laid out and thought out| as was the whole resort. We requested pool barriers for the plunge pool and they were put in place promptly. There was a travel cot all nicely set up with a mobile and change mat| in the bathroom should we have needed it was a little step for him to reach the basins and a smaller toilet seat that would have sat on the adult toilet.The restaurants were fantastic with the international having a vast choice of food every day at each meal time when we went there. At breakfast we ordered our little boys meal i.e. spag bol| sausage and mash and this was delivered to us in the late afternoon to feed him all prepared so we could then prepare him for bed and allow us to eat whilst he slept in his buggy. The beach was cleaned every morning| there were spare buckets and spades left on the beach for us to use| even the hawkers were friendly and didn't pester you once you had said no.We didn't want to leave the attention to detail was fab| the service sometimes was a little slow but is that us used to our fast lives we aren't used to sitting and chilling out?Saw a turtle the hotel side of the reef| and enjoyed the free glass bottom boat trip.We will be going back and have highly recommended it to friends we would like to thank Dean| Arvin and Jay in particular for being so friendly and helpful!,Horsham,29-05-14,No,5
Fabulous stay,"We stayed in a room with private splash pool on the ground floor. The room was much nicer| larger and more impressive| than the photos portrayed on the official website. With a fabulous outdoor shower| beautiful décor| huge room with king size bed and sliding doors leading onto our private wooden deck with splash pool| it was really much more than we expected. The room is just a few steps away from a beautiful white sandy beach which stretches the entire length of the resort. Water sport options were abundant and freely available to guests. All equipment was of high standard and the staff all professional and most helpful.We had the option of eating in all 6 of the on site restaurants even though we were on a ""full board"" option. The food was delicious and the wines included in the full board option| were not the usual average house wines| but the same excellent wines available on the wine list. The staff were great and so friendly. We enjoyed using the large and modern gym facilities every morning and our room was cleaned perfectly every day. The gardens and grounds were also kept neat and pristine. Even the beach gets a ""brush"" and cleaned every morning.Although the hotel was only about 40% full| there was some form of musical entertainment every night at the main bar and/or in La Caravelle bar/restaurant. The group| Diamond 4| was especially good and we enjoyed dancing to their great music. The buildings were most impressive| surrounded by water and palm trees| with no walls| open to nature with thatch roofs very much like in Bali. One can clearly see where the billion rand upgrade was spent.We truly enjoyed our stay and it was well worth the expense. The only area I felt they should improve on is breakfast - I know catering for hundreds of guests is limiting and difficult| but the quality of the food was not great. Some mornings all the fruit platters were empty and the 2 chefs could not keep up with replenishing| preparing fruit and doing egg orders. The streaky bacon was dry| over cooked and in tattered pieces. The mini sausages were also dry and over cooked. Besides this| the food served for lunches and dinners was excellent.",Johannesburg| South Africa,27-05-14,No,5
Nice hotel,Nice clean hotel. Food never bad but not out of this world good. Red tuna and a berry choc mousse stands out. Service was slow and once the waiters drop the food on your table dont expect to see them soon again| so get everything you want at the same time. Rooms nice and big| we had a room close to the pathway ...the whole day and from about 3am in the morning| they up and down with a cart that rattles. Sleep was disturbed a few times at night. They are not attentive to when you are in and out of your room| so if they want to come clean or change towels| they want to do it now... If you dont want to be disturbed| put the sign on the door| although they will then phone you to tell you they want to come change towels.. So plan your afternoon naps around their schedule. If you are shy and do not want to expose your milk cans| shower in the dark.. There is no curtain by the bathroom window.. Although it is on the top floor| a few rooms| including ours| from certain angles outside you have a good view in| especially at night when the light is on.The north of mauritius is beautiful... Snorkeling from the hotel when they go outside of lagoon is amazing. Do take a long walk along the beach. It is very safe. Its about a 4km stretch to the right when facing the sea all the way to club med. The beach of the hotel is narrow and dont expect much privacy... The chairs are in a row half a meter apart along the beach.The locals will approach you and attempt to sell you something probably once every 20 mins. If you sit on the hotel grounds and still want a seaview| there is a pathway between you and the beach| with hotel guests walking past all the time and locals shouting from the beach to get your attention. I probably make it sound more terrible than it is| but these little irritations do mount and i battle to see the value in this hotel. We have stayed all over mauritius and comparing to other 5 star hotels| this hotel just miss the mark. Its a tough choice because trou aux biches and the north is so beautiful but during your stay in this hotel| you miss what the other 5 star hotels on the island has to offer.,Johannesburg| South Africa,26-05-14,No,4
2 weeks in Parsdise,We have been here for 2 weeks to celebrate my big birthday| we have been spoilt| everything is so perfect. All the staff in every department are so vert helpful without exception. They remember your name and almost your room number!!! Everywhere is so clean and tidy| the gardens are immaculate so well cared for. There are 6 restaurants all serving a great selection of all types of food| nothing is duplicated. We would Love to think that we will be back one day. Many thanks to all at Trou aux Biches.,North wales,25-05-14,No,5
Hotel in Mauritius,Best and most beautiful hotel i Mauritius. The beach in marvelous| white sand| blue water and beautiful sunbeds. Food very good. Nice hotel shop. Located near Grand Baie. That has shops and bars and night clubs.,Stockholm| Sweden,22-05-14,No,5
Nice stay,I was at the Hotel On a incentive trip with a great group of people|however the hotels service was terrible always looking for tips as we were on a all inlusive package the staff was extremely unfriendly when something was ordered.Our room was once only cleaned at 3 in the afternoon|in the six days our mini bar was refiled once not once was the water in our room replaced the food was a far cry from 5star.Myself and my wife once went to the buffet restaurant and found the varity and quality of the food was double the standard as when our group went.I have travelled to Maurituis before and will always return but for a couple I will not recommend the hotel.On the positive the location is awesome and the grouns is true paradise.Thanks,London,19-05-14,No,3
Honeymoon Paradise,"We stayed at this lovely hotel for 6 nights on honeymoon. From the moment we arrived| we felt relaxed. Check-in was effortlessly done and a nice tough was being provided with a cold towel and a drink. The resort is set in magnificent grounds and it can take a while to find your way about! We stayed in a tropical junior suit situated in area ""4""| which was in the middle of the resort. The room was nicely kept and very spacious| but the highlight was surely the large outdoor shower. Mini-bar prices were high| so we bought water| crisps etc from the local shops| which is only a few minutes’ walk away. There are 6 restaurants to eat in and most require booking| which you can do at the front desk. Our favourites were the Indian and Thai. Breakfast in the morning is a buffet| where you can find all sorts of goodies - pancakes| French toast| eggs etc| all being cooked fresh while you wait. The beach is fantastic. White sands| beautiful blue sea and we had no trouble finding a bed. The only downside are the guys selling their wares| but it didn't intrude too much. Again| no trouble finding a bed by the pool if we fancied a change. There are lots of water activities available for free. We took out a pedalo a few times for example. Fatima| the General Manager| was always on hand if you needed something. She even drove us to a restaurant outside the hotel one night! We tried 1 place; Pescatore| which was delicious| but did cost about £110. All n all| a fantastic hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",London,16-05-14,No,5
Tranquility in paradise,Just returned from 10 days in paradise. We decided to celebrate a big birthday and an anniversary in Mauritius. Researching resorts in Mauritius is fun but tiring as well because there are so many amazing one to choose from. We finally settled for the Trou aux Biches Resort and I have to say we hit the jackpot. I can't imagine anything more beautiful. The resort is huge but set in a mature tropical garden. The botanical garden in Pampelmoose has waterlillies and that is about the only difference. At Trou aux Biches your room is in a botanical garden. I mentioned already that the resort is huge and when we arrived it was fully booked| however at no time had we the feeling to be part of a crowd. Enough deck chairs and you can ask the staff to reserve one for you. We had the pleasure to stay in a three bedroom villa and what can I say... We pinched ourselves daily thinking surely we will wake up and it is only a dream. The villa was spacious to say the least and having your own garden with a pool| you had to force yourself to go to other places. I have to mention the tropical outside shower because I never used the inside one. Showering under palm trees is pure bliss.The resort has 6 restaurants and the food is outstanding in every one. I recommend booking the + package because drinks are included. Half a bottle of wine per person or two beers plus water. We tried all restaurants and I can't say that one was better than an other| all were outstanding. Even the buffet restaurant served different dishes every day. Go for a walk in the resort and you can walk off some of the calories or have a swim in one of the seven pools| that is not counting the big one at the reception area. If you don't feel like walking order a club car and you get driven where you want to go. The staff at Trou aux Biches serve with a smile and always go the extra mile to make your holiday as enjoyable as possible. The beach at Trou aux Biches is wonderful| beautiful sand. We wore our beach shoes in the water but it is not a necessity. The water is warm and soft as lotion.I would like to say thank you to Fatima and the amazing staff at the resort for a very memorable holiday. I can highly recommend the resort and returning to Mauritius I would always choose it again.,Auckland| New Zealand,13-05-14,No,5
Brilliant hotel situated on a white sandy beach,We went on our honeymoon in September 2013 and stayed at this wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived| we could feel the friendliness of the staff at this hotel. Whilst we were waiting to be checked in| we were offered a cold towel and a welcome drink. We were upgraded to the tropical junior suite with an outdoor shower as we were on our honeymoon. This hotel has one of the best white sandy beaches in Mauritius. It is situated on the Northwest part of the Island| which is just over an hour’s drive from the airport. The hotel also offered us a complimentary honeymoon gift voucher to be used in one of their boutique shops which we used to get a T-shirt and a sarong. We dined at the Indian restaurant every evening where chef Satish and his team made Jain vegetarian food for us. The food at the Indian restaurant was amazing and the waiters gave us an excellent service! I would definitely recommend eating at the Indian restaurant. On the beach| there is a beach house which is run by the hotel. It offers complimentary watersports such as Water Skiing|sailing| windsurfing|glass bottom boat|pedal boat| kayak|snorkeling e.t.c. If do you want to do other watersports such as paragliding| speedboat| there are a few vendors on the beach who will approach you for this| but be sure to haggle with them for the prices!Nearby to the hotel when you turn right from the main entrance of the hotel is a small village where you can buy souvenirs’ and there is also a small bank with a cash machine and a money exchanging service.Overall this is one of the best hotels in Mauritius and I would highly recommend it.,Geneva| Switzerland,28-04-14,No,5
Truly paradise!,We chose the Trou au Biches Resort for our honeymoon and stayed 9 nights in April 2014.We absolutely fell in love with this hotel & its location.The beach| layout| food & rooms were all beyond our expectations.There was always plenty to do amongst all the included activities offered by the hotel.We will definitely go back and can only highly recommend it!,Geneva| Switzerland,27-04-14,No,5
Heaven on Earth,We travelled to Mauritius - Trou aux Biches Resort in October 2013| for 15nights. We arrived to a not so good start| with our room not being ready for us and was still dirty from the visitors before us. That was a bit of a damper of our trip. The resort was extremely busy during our stay and was fully booked| hence the service throughout was not up to 5 star standard. However after saying this - we did complain to management and they went out of their way to make our stay amazing. The service was top notch and management made regular checks on us to see that we were 100% happy. That was absolutely wonderful service from her. We were also upgraded from a family suite to a beachfront suite and that was just perfect. The beachfront rooms are truly stunning| and the view of paradise outside was picturesque. We were a stones throw away from the waters edge. We had our own private splash pool which was great for the kids to cool off after being on the beach. The food manager also organised toddler appropriate meals for my little one| which was fantastic| and she loved all the food bought to her. The restaurant's are all wonderful and the food is out of this world| especially the Indian restaurant| what an experience!! The buffet restaurant also offered a huge variety every evening| and delicious breakfasts. The beach at the resort is the most beautiful on the island by far. It is clear| turquoise and fringed with lush palm trees. It really was postcard beautiful. There are a lot of activities right on the beach and the snorkelling through the hotel boat house was great. We saw so many fish. There are also people offering tube rides for the family which was fun for all of us. They even took photos of us as we raced across the water screaming!! The pool area is huge and never seemed crowded or noisy| there is a great knee deep pool area for the kiddies to frolic in and a wonderful big family sized chair in the water for us to relax on right by the little ones swimming. Was our favourite spot| so so relaxing! The resort on the whole is a beautiful| well maintained place on a superb stretch of beach. We loved our visit there very much| and will perhaps return one day again.,Paarl| Western Cape| South Africa,26-04-14,No,5
Fantastic!,My wife and I stayed here for 8 nights for the second part of our honeymoon in August 2013. I can't rate this place highly enough everything was superb - the property| the room| the food| the service. We had an amazing time and would highly recommend it.,London| United Kingdom,22-04-14,No,5
Amazing Place| but go B&B!,"We went on our honeymoon to this wonderful destination April 8-19th 2014.The hotel is beautifully designed on a great beach| west facing for some awesome sunsets. We stayed in the tropical junior suite set back from the beach (actually a good thing as more private) but only a pleasant 2 minute walk to the beach through some immaculate gardens. We arrived after a long journey and got a very pleasant check in as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne and spa massage voucher as it was our honeymoon. Sadly the promised gift voucher for the boutique never surfaced although it didn't bother us in the end. The suite is lovely and includes an outdoor shower (concealed from viewers of course!). Other reviewers are right in that there are a lot of families that stay there but not a problem for us. The complex is large enough for privacy and romance| especially if you do the right thing and venture out of the hotel for dinner. Re the beach itself - It can be busy with boats and the occasional hawker flogging stuff but it doesn't spoil the experience. Plenty of loungers and good snorkeling just a few metres out (Moray eels and fish!)We opted for the B&B option rather than half board or fully inclusive which was clearly the best way to go (see below). All the staff are very attentive and friendly and go out of their way to assist and the room is cleaned twice a dayTry the spa also if you can as it provides a lovely massage along with steam room and saunaBreakfast buffet is plentiful with every option catered for.Okay all good so far but some negatives - Very expensive extra options. We wanted to SCUBA dive and did but used the local Dive Dreams centre in Trou Aux BIches rather than the onsite dive centre as it was so much cheaper; barely anyone was diving with them (probably as a consequence of this!). The same goes for the boutique| the taxi services and the meals. We decided to dine one night at the hotel rather than in Trou Aux Biches so we opted for Blue Ginger. Had to book 2 days in advance as it was booked up but I have no idea why. The restaurant is wonderfully designed and laid out but the food is not up to scratch. Starter was 2 spoons of poorly flavoured Thai ""salad"" and a crab cake which was more like a chicken nugget. This was followed by a prawn & wonton soup ( with regulation 1 wonton| 1 prawn only!)| an overcooked fish and 2 overcooked curries with about 2 sppons of rice Dessert capped things off with fruit salad which looked like breakfast leftovers. All this and 3 beers for Rs 5000 (£100)!! Trying so hard to be a London high end restaurant they actually forgot to flavour the food or provide enough of it. I left still hungry! The local restaurants are so much better and half the price. Even the local beach shacks offered tastier morsels (samosas| marlin baguettes etc) Suffice to say we did not eat on site again for dinner. A real shame as the hotel as so much else which is really well done.In summary we gave it 5 stars for the hotel| staff| location etcHowever make sure you go B&B and eat lunch and dinner out in Trou Aux Biches. tastier| cheaper and actually supporting the local businesses and community",London| United Kingdom,21-04-14,No,5
Yes! if you are looking for a nice beach for children,The hotel is very convenient and comfortable for families with children. Food is ok| Service is not bad| The rooms are large and clean with good housekeeping. Try the Italian restaurant which is the best among others. Thai is not really authentic| Open buffet is very good for the families. This is not a hotel for Romance but there is a fantastic sunset that you can enjoy on the beach. There is a sandy clean beach with sea whihc is not agressive far from big waves offering safer environment for kids. The only problem is the beach sellers will disturb you many times trying to sell you things. You cannot avoid it since the security guards of the Hotel seem not discouraging the trade at all. Finally| yes if you are looking some quite place and nice beach to go with kids this is the right one.,Zurich| Switzerland,18-04-14,No,4
Beachcomber Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa| 30.03.-12.04.2014,Check InFirst off| the reception area is stunning. There is a water feature with trees| palms and you a direct view of the sea. The process was very relaxing which I always find very nice after a long exhausting flight. You will be seated and presented with a welcoming drink (some sort of lemongrass ice tea| a bit too sweet for me) and a cold towel. After that you will be taken to your suite/villa with a golf cart. We were lucky to be upgraded from a junior suite to a tropical junior suite. GroundsSimply stunning. You almost get the feeling of being in a rainforest or a zoo. So many different birds| little lizards and we even saw a fruitbat hanging in the huge tree in front of our room (632). The resort is very big and spread out but there are always golf carts if you do not feel like walking. The grounds probably impressed us the most. It is just hard not to relax in such a nice environment. SuiteWe stayed in the Tropical Junior Suite number 632. This type of Suite gives you 70m2 of space| more than enough for the 2 of us. The suite comes with a king bed| tv (a bit slow and smallish)| a huge bathroom with inside and outside rainshowers both of which offer excellent pressure and of course you also get a bathtub and dual sinks. Nothing to fault here. Our housekeeper kept the room spotlessly clean. At turn down you will also get a free bottle of water. PoolsThere are a total of 7 pools| 6 smaller pools and the big infinity pool near the reception area. All the pools are very well kept and offer plenty of sun loungers. Also the temperature was very pleasant. BeachFrom looking at pictures and Google maps etc. I thought that the beach might not be that good. Boy was I wrong. White sand| turquoise water and a view to die for. Also there were not that many beach hawkers. Boats also very mentioned as a problem in other reviews| sure there are boats but it really wasn’t that bad. I did not disturb me from relaxing. RestaurantsThere are 6 restaurants offering international| Indian| Thai| Italian| and seafood cuisine. We only visited the Buffet| Mahiya and Blue Ginger. The other menus did not really appeal to us. For the a la carts you will have to make reservations. We did that 1-2 days in advance and never had any problems. You can show up as you please as there is not a specific time tied to your reservation. L’Oasis (Buffet)L’Oasis is the main restaurant open for breakfast| lunch and dinner. Breakfast was superb| almost everything you could want or think of. And to my surprise| the bread was as good as in Switzerland which is rarely the case in beach resorts. Breakfast gets a 5/5 from my side. Lunch however was a completely different story. The service was inexistent and the food was also not something to write home about. We ate there just twice in our two weeks.I would rate the food quality at dinner as pretty good| however there were not enough choices for a 5* buffet. Service was better but also lacking attention when the restaurant was busy| which was the case in most of the second week of our stay. Also the menu repeats itself after a week. Le Caravelle (International / Lunch)Le Caravelle was our go to restaurant for lunch| service here was better than at L’Oasis but also lacking. The food however was pretty good and the setting is beautiful. Mahiya (Indian)Mahiya is the Indian restaurant. They have a set menu which changes every 3 days. You will get 3 different starters and 3-4 entrees one of which costs a little supplement (300 Rupees) as well as a little desert. The food and service is superb. As a matter of fact we liked this restaurant the most. Bottles of wine start at 1300 rupees and go all the way up to 3000 and 4500-6000 for champagne. That said| the wine is pretty good and when you are on full board| you will get a discount of 1200 rupees on every bottle. Blue Ginger (Thai)This is the Thai themed restaurant| the service is similar if not better than at Mahiya and the food is also very very good. Here you will also have a set menu with one course more (soup) than at Mahiya. Service overallService was pretty good the first week we were there when the hotel was only about half full. It declined in the second week when the hotel seemed to be at almost full capacity. Sometimes you had to wait 10-15 minutes after being seated at lunch for someone to bring you the menu and something to drink. That is just not acceptable for a resort that claims to be 5*+| hell it is not even acceptable for a 4* resort. Reception however was always very helpful and when we had a problem with our TV| 5 minutes later the technician was at our room and solved the problem (thank good otherwise I would have missed the champions league)The car provided by the hotel is a BMW X5| which we never used so can’t comment on that but it was a newer model.BarsThere are two bars| the Main bar right next to L’Oasis at the main pool and the bar at La Caravelle (International cuisine) which is located right next to the beach. The cocktails were somewhat strange| depending on the bar chef| some days they were very good and sometimes they were let’s say| improvable. However the staff was efficient so no complaints there. EntertainmentEvery night there is a DJ| a band or a dance/fire show. All of which were pretty good. We especially enjoyed the two brothers and their band. The younger one really should enter a music show like the voice. Amazing singer. Fitness/TennisThere is a big fitness room divided into 3 parts with up to date equipment| two table tennis tables and a badminton court. Also there are 6 tennis courts all in good condition. Reserve in the morning and you will always get a court. It’s a Head Tennis Academy so you will get Head rackets. The tennis balls you will have to buy but they only cost you 500 Rupees.We did not do any water sports activities| so can’t comment on that. SpaThey spa area is located next to the sport facilities in the back of the resort. You get an instant feeling of serenity when you enter. Our treatments were pretty good and the spa pool is also a nice place to relax. You can only use these facilities at the day of your treatment. Check outWe asked about the possibility for a late check out and they offered us the room for as long as we needed it and we also were able to eat lunch at no additional charge. The bill was 100% correct and we were checked out in about 2 minutes. Points of improvementHere are a few points I would like to address. Breakfast should be till 11 not 10 in the morning.Service at lunch has to get better. I observed many people having to wait 10-15 minutes to even be recognized by a member of the staff. Also drink services should be expanded to the little pools not only the main pool and the beach are. ConclusionA very nice resort with the most beautiful grounds and setting. If they can iron out the few points mentioned| especially the lunch service problem| we will definitely recommend it to our family and friends.,Zurich| Switzerland,14-04-14,Yes,4
Very lovely hotel,I'm the personal assistant of a very famous person in the world| so I traveled with her in the most beautiful hotel in the world ex: savoy of London| ritz of Paris| excelsior of Rome ecc. I stayed in the beach front senior suite with pool| it was very nice and clean. The beach was a little bit crowed but said that I stayed very well| and i think that if i can afford| I will come again with my girlfriend in this nice hotel.,New York City| New York,12-04-14,Yes,5
Lovely relaxing stay,Just come back from a lovely 9 days stay at this resort which has recently undergone a massive renovation so everything is very pleasant. Accommodations were excellent| we had a 2 bedroom villa. Beds were very clean| comfortable| plenty of space with modern bathrooms. One of my favourite features is the outdoor showers. Don't worry if that's not your thing as there are indoor ones as well. We also had outdoor table| chairs and lounger which were perfect for al fresco breakfasts which overlooked beautifully kept gardens.Beach is also great. Softest white sand. Clean clear and gently sea. Quite a lot of free beach activities for people wanting more activity| kayaks| snorkelling| paddle boarding etc. Good selection of restaurants| fish| Italian| European| Thai| Indian as well as the general nightly buffet all of which can be used with half board/ full board meal plans. Some items are with additional supplements though but still plenty of choice. Food quality was generally very good. One thing that I would like to praise the resort staff on is the friendly attentive service. They've got this just about right| not too stuffy| not to lax but very personable| helpful and friendly. One small annoyance though was the beach traders| so many of them. They were though not pushy| yes| they wanted to try to make a sale but were polite and leave if you said you weren't interested| just had to do this about 20 times a day. Grrrr! Gym facilities were good| with tennis and coach if requires| table tennis and pool table near the gym. Down points apart from beach traders is the drinks were expensive| works out about £10 for one cocktail. Now that's London high end price. Also the spa services were expensive but if it's a massage you want there is an excellent place just outside the resort opposite to the police station. Very clean and professional centre. My tip - go there ;). Also| don't be late for breakfast| they wrap up snarky at 10 am much to my sons annoyance.All said and done. This resort is excellent| if we plan another Mauritius trip we would certainly return. I have no worries about recommending this place.,Bishops Stortford| United Kingdom,12-04-14,Yes,5
Just perfect....,My wife and I are currently staying here and it's no exaggeration to say that it meets all of our expectations and surpasses some. I have no idea how anyone can give a bad review if this fabulous hotel and resort. The rooms are very well appointed and traditional - fantastic shower which is important to me!The restaurants are all good and staff genuinely want to help you have a great holiday. Beautiful spa too!Yesterday we took a boat trip from the beach to see dolphins - which we did but also managed to swim with them in open water - a wonderful experience!!!If you fancy Mauritius choose this hotel - you'll love it.......... Unless you're nuts or someone who always looks for faults! Just relax ans have a fabulous time......,Vienna| Austria,11-04-14,Yes,5
Paradise on earth,We stayed for our honey/babymoon for 9 nights in a tropical junior suite plus. The room was nicely located close to the beach and the main restaurant area. it was spacious| clean and modern with a huge bathroom incl oudoor shower. The twice daily houskeeping service is excellent. Aircondition very sufficient| only the TV/programm is lacking -but hey who really needs that. Free internet was working perfectly in the room even at the pool area. We always took breakfast and dinner in the main buffet| which was alright. There is a lot of lamb options and fish/seafood for dinner. Since we stayed on a honeymoon package also lunch was included that we took in the fish restaurant (same small menue every day with daily changing dish). I guess the only thing we can complain about is the cost of the drinks (250 MRU for 1 glass of apple juice is really ridiculous). The mini club offers an excellent service and you can have your little ones (starting at 3 years) have a good time playing and swimming. The pool is absolutely gorgous as is the beach! You can even use the services that the boat house offers for free (snorkeling| water skiing| padelo etc). We really had a very relaxing stay and would love to come back again|,Vienna| Austria,11-04-14,Yes,5
This hotel is amazing,Words can not express how much my husband and i enjoyed our experience here. From first arriving to our wedding day to the rest of our holiday was beyond excellent. Fatima is fantastic. Virginie was just brilliant she was our wedding coordinator and did not leave our side. She organised everything to the last detail| I can not thank her enough she is just wonderful! Debora did my hair and makeup in the fantastic Clarins spa. I was nervous as this is my job at home so I'm fussy but she did a brilliant job and did exactly what I wanted. The waiting and room staff are just so professional and so lovely. All in all it is a holiday we will never forget!!! ,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,10-04-14,Yes,5
Pretty Awesome,Stay for a work conference| worst places in the world. Sorry| can't comment on the pricing. March/Early April was not packed-but awesome weather. Only stayed in the Hotel| will go back next time and attempt to climb some of those amazing mountains.Good wifi| on-time service| reasonable buffets| nice beach| good place to sit and relax| a few activities as per the website.Nice rooms and generally well maintained rooms| surroundings and facilities.Not so good-need to limit hawkers on the beach| not that bad| bad when you are engrossed in a book| it's annoying. No hand or body lotions in the room.Apart from that great place| service and food.Go and enjoy.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,06-04-14,Yes,5
Do it to me again and again . . .,What a wonderful relaxing holiday in the lap of luxury. I am used to this type of seriously pampered holiday| so to be treated like a legend at this stellar service resort| was bliss. Next time I would take the all inclusive option| meaning all drinks| food and breakfast are included. You don't even have to walk around the place| you just ring reception for a golf cart to come and fetch you...within ten minutes they are at your door to fetch you. But fantastic has one down side| the many flies at the open air breakfast and lunch areas. A couple of those electronic electra blitz machines| discreetly mounted would clear the fly problem at a rapid rate. The spa was platinum class too. Had four different treatments there and I could go on and on about how great they were. They outside hotel activities were supurb| little side note| book from the touts on the beach| it's much cheaper than through the hotel. Shhhhhh!Overall I will return there. The staff are all respectful| professional and happy to have you there.,Western Cape| South Africa,01-04-14,No,5
Beach bliss,Glistening water and beauty all round. This resort has so much with a great choice of dining| activities and friendliness all round. We visited in October which had perfect weather with loads and loads of sunshine. We loved their restaurants. The free snorkelling was much fun ... although the remaining reef is pretty much the only spot for seeing the array of fish. Many beach resorts promise much but dont deliver. Trou aux Biches delivers! You can seek the quietness of your room with private pool. Or you can venture at night to their shows and bands. Life at it's best. Highly recommend this resort for families| honeymooners and couples seeking quality.,Melbourne| Australia,28-03-14,No,5
Amazing holidays| great hotel!,I stayed 10 days at Trou aux Biches and had a wonderful experience.Outstanding facilities| great suite| large choice of restaurants (6) so great variety... Some activities on site| but not too many| and very nice staff. Super modern Sports center| and great Spa.I felt my stay was unique! I highly recommend.,Boulogne-Billancourt| France,26-03-14,No,5
Out of this world,We stayed at the resort about 16 years ago. So couldn't believe how this resort has been upgraded and changed. I could not fault or find anything wrong with either our lovely room with the outside shower to the large selections of different restaurants. So there is something for every taste bud. Booking is essential for the other speciality restaurants. What I can say is that I'm glad we took a full package otherwise it can be expensive. The bar prices were costly. We celebrated our 30 the anniversary and was brought a lovely cake. It's a huge resort so one never feels like its full or busy. Will be back hopefully soon,South Africa,25-03-14,Yes,5
Holiday Weekend,Rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Unfortunately| two thirds of the hotel no longer has a sea view but the gardens are well maintained. Friendly staff| superb food| great restaurants| nicely designed. Restaurants located next to the sea and in the middle of water features.,Quatre Bornes| Africa,22-03-14,Yes,5
an excellent property!!,the resort was very well located.we had 4 night stay in the resort and i must say that i was mesmerized by the size and the beauty of this property. the staff was very nice and warm. the room was very comfy and the balcony in the room was a nice touch..in terms of location| there are many restaurants at just walking distance from the hotel and also in house dining is nice but expensive..in all i'd say that it was a very start to our honeymoon and would come again if given a chance..,Ludhiana| Punjab| India,18-03-14,Yes,5
A nice but not quite a 5-star hotel,We have just returned from our 10-day holiday in Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa. We are frequent travelers| have seen many 5-star / well-appointed hotels and resorts in several continents and have become quite discerning in terms of price – quality ratio. The hotel and grounds are picture perfect. The garden is huge| it is extremely well taken care of (I even saw a gardener trimming the lawn with a pair of what seemed to me kitchen scissors)| the number of plant species is enormous| flowers blossoming everywhere. Just beautiful. The main lobby and restaurants are very charming| the beach immaculate| the sea balmy and the weather gorgeous. As many other visitors have also said it is very tranquil despite the number of guests at the resort. Service is a 5-star standard| and many employees go the extra mile to make you feel relaxed and pampered (and hopefully get some tips| too). Also the possibility for an early check-in and late check-out are real treats after or before a 12-hour flight….. Very nice.Then to the not-quite-a-5-star-hotel comments. Some other guests have also mentioned about the food and its quality & prices. First| the breakfast. Again we may be spoiled due to our past experiences but it was a bit of a letdown. During the 10 days stay the menu was exactly the same every morning and the selection was limited compared to some other top class hotels we’ve stayed at. We are not keen on carbs which meant the selection for us was fruit (which is great if you’re there at the right time to pick the exotic fruits before they were gone) and sausages and omelets/eggs. All salads and vegetables were missing| with the exception of fried tomatoes| which were tasteless and cold. People who do eat carbs| the selection was ok. Secondly| the dinner. The price / quality ratio was poor – on the average 100 Eur for two people without drinks for a very mediocre meal (both a la carte and buffet). The restaurants we enjoyed most were the Thai and Indian ones (a la carte)| albeit the quality was a bit inconsistent there as well. They have fixed menus| which means you don’t have a selection| you take what they offer. Some parts of it were delicious| some other parts not so good. The buffet at the hotel is just a shadow of a regular Iberostar hotel buffet in Europe or the Caribbean| just to give an example. The prices outside of the hotel are less than a half| and it pays off to wander around and try local restaurants to meet and see how the locals eat (the wealthier ones – most of the locals cannot afford to eat in any restaurants ) and get a feel of the local flair. As said| the sea is beautiful with incredible colors and nice temperature. The sand is so white that you need sunglasses to keep your eyes open… Sun loungers are plentiful and you can always find a quiet spot no matter when you go. The only downside is the traffic at sea. If you think you’re going to get a paradise beach with no other sound but the waves you’ll be disappointed. The boats and all water activities are| well| active all day long. The boats drive very close to the beach| some of them with high speed and very close to swimmers.Also the beach vendors are frequent visitors who will leave you in peace with a determined ‘No’. The beach is lovely to stroll on at night: the waves you hear| the stars you see| the tranquility you feel - one of our favorite things to do during the entire holiday.Touring around the island is also worthwhile. It is surprisingly populated and seeing and meeting the local people is always fascinating and puts your luxury trip into perspective. We had a private tour guide for a day (seems quite popular) who showed us the places where most tourists seem to go when they take a day off from the beach lounging. We also spent a day driving around on a bus. Very interesting| inexpensive and a great opportunity to be with the locals and see how they live.All in all| it really is about your expectations. If you want ultimate tranquility combined with luxury| head for Seychelles or Maldives (for the same money)| if you want a livelier option and don’t mind paying extra for the food & having active beach life| Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa is a good alternative.,Berlin| Germany,17-03-14,Yes,4
Beautiful resort| great for a special trip,My husband and I spent 5 nights here for our honeymoon| and we are very happy with our choice. We wanted something out of the box| and our trip to Mauritius and Cape Town fit the bill. Apparently there are not to many Americans who make the long trip to Mauritius| but we are glad we did. We were greeted with a cold towel| drink and fruit| ushered to the buffet for breakfast| and even able to check in early. The room (tropical junior suite +) was very cool. The bathroom was huge| and we were obsessed with the outdoor shower| which was magnificent! Bed was comfortable| with plenty of space in the room. Room was properly cleaned and maintained each day. The breakfast was great - lots of choices and everything tasted great. We liked the lounge chairs that were slightly off the beach - peaceful and calm. We did a catamaran| paddle boat and kayak - all included and all fun. The staff was lovely and professional and couldn't do enough for the guests. Internet was decent and reliable. Weather during our stay was great - a little humid at times| but coming from snow covered NY - we didn't care! No mosquitoes at all. Definitely bring lots of sunscreen. We did a couples massage and the spa was great. Peaceful| quiet| relaxing| and hanging out at the spa pool afterwards was also very nice.The only downside is that the cost of food and drinks is over the top. We live near NYC and are no strangers to high end/costly restaurants| but the fact that there was no reasonably priced options at night was rough. We ate at the buffet the first night and the cost was $130 (US). While everything tasted great - it was just too costly| especially when we were splurging to stay at this lovely resort in the first place. We solved this issue by simply walking into Trou aux Biches each evening and eating at one of the local places. All were good| tasty| and an unbelievable bargain. Same for the drinks. Again| we are no strangers to expensive drinks due to where we live| but a Pina Colada for $15 should have been great - was just ok and a little small.The above comments should not deter anyone from staying here - we loved the place and enjoyed our walk into town for dinner every night.,Long Island| New York,09-03-14,Yes,5
Beautifully designed resort in a superb location and very well run,It has been a super holiday. The resort lives up to its advertising| with well designed rooms| facilities next to the sea and the top quality restaurants. The staff are super. The gardens are beautifully planted and ver well kept. The beach is immaculate. We have dined wonderfully well and each evening felt special thanks to the chefs and staff. The climate in early March has been a bit rainy but we went in the rainy season. The flowers and shrubs are blossoming so well and the showers so short it has not detracted. Only one restaurant| Il Corallo| let the side down. The cooking| service and overpriced wine list made it a forgettable evening. But well done to all the staff| from room staff to chefs| water sports and Gardeners.,London| United Kingdom,06-03-14,Yes,5
Incredible time!!!,My girlfriend and I stayed at this fabulous hotel for 2 weeks this past February. What can I say|we loved our time there!!! The service was fantastic|the people there always smiling and here for you|and the beach simply one of the best on the island.I recommend this amazing hotel to anybody wanting a great and relaxing time in Mauritius!! Also|try taking tennis lessons with Fabrice at the sport center|great guy and great coach,Paris| France,01-03-14,Yes,5
Dream,It was almost perfect vacation thank to this beautiful hotel. Amazing! I never expected such a full compliance between advertisements and reality! The place is unique! We didn’t go to the botanic garden in Mauritius after seeing the parks and alleys in the hotel. I cannot imagine how it is possible to maintain all those vegetables| trees| summing pools| flowers| lawns| alleys and beaches! There were constantly workers in the park| cutting coconuts from the trees| cleaning the swimming pools etc.| without disturbing peace and quietness of the area. There are different areas with different vegetations and arrangement accents. You can walk at least one hour to see all the gardens and areas in the hotel. One of the best hotels I’ve seen! Very comfortable houses| quiet environment| swimming pools for every 6-8 houses allowing to relax in case of strong wind (what is not common| except during cyclones) or just in the evening. I cannot describe all amazing thing I enjoyed in this hotel! Even if there are a lot of guests| you have privacy and the feeling you are alone. Big spaces| big gardens| extremely long coast line for the hotel guests. There is only one row sun beds on the beach| so you are always first line sun bed. You have also the option to sit in some more quiet place just 5 meters further in specially designated sandy areas under the coconut trees. You can order a drink any time| thanks to the small electric cars going back and forth all day. We worried about what would happen in case of cyclone (more common for February)| but we had one and it didn’t influenced our vacation negatively.Breakfast is more than enough| but it lacks specificity; it is like in any other European hotel| with not a big choice of fruits and vegetables| which was surprising for me. I noticed than mango fruits were extremely rare and only the most stubborn survivors deserved them . Breakfast restaurants are very picturesque| the staff is very helpful and friendly. The beach is excellent| long sandy coast| perfect location. There are no strong streams| the depth is optimal| allowing either summing or enjoying sitting in the shallow waters. It is suitable and safe for children.We had a boat trip to the near islands (Gabriel| Flat island..)| and the price was too high for what we received; I mean we even didn’t get to the islands| because of the waves. In my opinion it was clear for the boat staff in the beginning of the trip (30 minutes earlier)| but they just didn’t say that our agreement is not possible to fulfill. Anyway| they treat you like a tourist and we actually are tourists| but a little bit honesty and respect will not harm the staff of the boat house.The most popular phrase “Welcome to the paradise” is a little bit exaggerated| but it is almost true for the hotel. If you know what to expect there| then you are OK. For me it was surprise that there was almost no chance to ride a bicycle or motorcycle because of the narrow roads. Also| it is almost not possible to have lunch after 2.30 p/m. or dinner after 8.30 p.m. It is unusual for a summer resort| I accept this| but it is still strange for me. What the restaurants do| is to close at 3 p/m/ and to open at 6.30- 7 p.m. Then they accommodate the guests once: there is no such thing like one table is released and other guests are taking the seats there. Restaurants are still empty at 7 p.m. and already empty at 10 p.m.The temperatures are just perfect| Never too hot or cold. You don’t need jackets and switchers. And you never sweat (unless you sit in the sun at noon ! ). As everywhere else (at similar vacation destinations)| the paradise is heavily exploited; the attractions you know from the guides or the books are almost obligatory for all the trips| no matter organized by the agency| privately or by the local guide. You will be accompanied by crowds all the way and it is worth to think about what is better: relax on a perfect beach or run back and forth all day.,Plovdiv| Bulgaria,01-03-14,Yes,5
Spend your money elsewhere! ,"We are staying at this hotel right now| just finding some peace and rest at the beach is not possible.There are loads of freeloathers non-guests in front of our appartment every day all day who take up all space. Several requests to relocate have not been honored by the management. They do however charge big prices for deluxe ""private"" suites! We are relocating!!!",Amsterdam,28-02-14,Yes,1
Pleased everyone,This is an excellent hotel| - beautiful gardens| great beach| pools everywhere| good food and excellent service. Our family suite was spacious - two bedrooms and two bathrooms and an outside shower and a terrace looking over the lush gardens. It is a large hotel but doesn't feel like it| but if distances are too large ( I have difficulty walking ) there are buggies to pick you up.The restaurants were good| especially the Thai and Indian | but make sure you book.I'm not a fan of buffets but the breakfast and lunch here were excellent| with a good amount of Mauritian cooking. Lots of activities available for our teenage daughters and plenty of space to be quiet and watch the sea or snooze! The only disappointment for me was limited sea swimming area due to boats and water sports. We had a marvellous time and are already longing to return.,London| United Kingdom,25-02-14,No,5
Beautiful room,We stayed in a beachfront suite with pool and it was beautiful. Fantastic bathroom with outdoor shower. Large room with a great pool and view. Despite being a large hotel it didn't feel like one which was good. The only downside to this hotel was the service in the restaurants. The staff seemed very rushed and never smiled and didn't have time for you at all. Not 5 star at all which I felt really let the hotel down. The food was OK but not wow. They needed music in the restaurant to help the ambience too.Late check out was a breeze which did make it stand out from other hotels. No additional cost which made a difference. There were some great staff including Bernard| Dave and Rajesh. They all had lovely personalities and made us feel special.If they get the restaurant service right this hotel could be very special.,Bingley| United Kingdom,24-02-14,No,3
Great Family Stay,We had the whole family| mum & Dad| 2 brothers & sister our husband and wifes and all the kids with ages from 2 to 72. We all had a fantastic time| the kids loved the hotel and all of us felt very relaxed and enjoyed our stay. The faces of the kids at meals time was amazing as they did not know which food to eat first. The rooms are very good| lots of space and the outside shower is fantastic. My sister's little boy would never get in a shower until he saw this and now you cannot get him out of the shower. All in all great hotel| great staff| food room| nice rooms and what a outstanding beach and location. The price you pay is worth it. Thanks guys for a great time.,Mauritius,21-02-14,No,5
Excellent beach & resort restaurants,We spent a week in the resort during mid-December. The reason we chose this hotel was because of the time of the year| this side of the island is more sheltered from the winds| and the fact that the hotel is fronting the best stretch of beach on the island| based on my research online.The hotel did not disappoint in terms of the beach & setting. The junior suite are spacious| but could be better decorated at this price bracket? The large| well-designed bathroom did compensate for the bedroom as the latter was quite bland| & it was nice that the evening turn down service ensured the bathroom was dry & sand-free by the time we were back from dinner.The restaurants are one of my favourite parts of the hotel. The Thai| Indian ones are particularly good. I'm normally not keen on Indian food| but since trying the curry there I've changed my mind. The staff at the restaurant couldn't do more for us| and we enjoyed learning to play the santoor from Rajesh| who is a very accomplished performer. In my opinion| if you want to stay where the beach & restaurants are excellent| the Beachcomber is not a bad choice on the west side of this island.,London| United Kingdom,09-02-14,No,4
Great resort but services are not 5 star,This was our second time we have stayed in this beautiful resort (same time last and this year) and we could feel a big drop in the level of services offered. I was also reading some of other reviews and I tend to agree with some saying that it feels like management change or serious cost cutting exercise most probably due to the size of the resort. The resort itself is very nice| quiet| rooms and nice and spacious (even though some might require small maintenance already). Beach is very nice and I must say they did very good job this year by cleaning the sharp corrals from the beach. Last year it was difficult to walk barefoot on the beach. One thing to be however aware of is that the beach is public| so you get a certain number of locals in there as well as many walk by salesman that can be sometimes quite disturbing.The area that we were very disappointed with was food and restaurants. The quality of food and selection went down dramatically| presentation and its preparation as well. There is not enough staff in the kitchen and restaurant to prepare the food and present it as it should be. So e.g. you can have one person doing eggs| pancakes and at the same time cleaning fruit without washing hands in between the jobs| the fruit is not appropriately cleaned/peeled and it’s just smashed in the bowl. The breakfast is very same every day| so if you stay longer it gets quite boring. One annoying thing is the actual food quality as 2 members of my family were seriously food poisoned and had to stay in bed for few days with fever etc. So you must be careful what you eat and avoid fresh fish and seafood which is a shame. Also the weekend staff is the temporary team so the quality of service drops dramatically over the weekend - like missing bread| butter| glasses and cups on the table. The team in the restaurant is not managed at all| so they just all run around in chaos and you need to catch them if you need anything. My feeling is that this will keep deteriorating since out of the season the number of quests goes down even more and they have issue maintaining this huge resort.,Nicosia| Cyprus,04-02-14,No,3
Very nice month stay,imagine to stay whole month in one particular hotel? you would see all the aspects probably. So did we. Pricey hotel but very very nice food| beautiful gardens| huge territory| cosy and comfortable rooms. For children its heaven though kids center might be slightly bigger and better equipped. Stuff and management are really doing their best to treat you as a VIP. The only thing i should advise| double check your orders when placing in rests| bars or over the room service and mind the tips always - they will never forget you. Hope next winter to be back there!,walsall,26-01-14,No,5
WOW got married,WOW. WOW. WOW Let me start of by thanking everyone for our special day and stay at this resort and spa . We arrived at this place thinking wow | amazing we got greeted with a warm friendly smile and at reception we got given exotic welcome drink and fresh facial towels . Surrounded by a wow of tranquil calming retreat knowing we chose the perfect place for our wedding/honeymoon .After the wedding prep we got golf buggy to our beachside villa | WOW again just like the brochure but better . Couldn't believe for the little bit more upgrade we got this . Then the view to the Indian Ocean right outside our patio door . Amazing room . Outdoor shower. huge bathroom huge everything Simply the best place I have ever been too. Our holiday started to great feeling . We explored the complex to find everything was well maintained | clean. The Food at each of the restaurants day and night came beautiful presented and tasted exquisite . The staff was friendly and each one went out there way to make you feel welcome and spoke to you as if you came there for years .The pools were amazing . The beach was amazing . Weather was mid to high 20sOur wedding day was flawless . Perfect on the beach and everything .The day time beach activities was a godsend as they were free and broke up a bit of the day. 1 small tiny down side of this place was that come the evening everybody would really go back to there rooms as price of drinks was expensive and people would go to the local shop to get them . Evening entertainment was limited in all honesty but didn't spoil our time there at all . We ventured out to see what Mauritius was about . We visited the zoo| a must thing to stroke the lions . We also done the zip line. Wow again . We swam at about 10ft with wild dolphins on a boat trip and spent a trip on a boat at the bottom of the island with a BBQ on the beach . Overall I would high recommend this place I would go back but I would like to visit Maldives and Seychelles if I was to spend this kind of money again !,walsall,16-01-14,No,5
excellence failure due to too many boats!!!,That's a great resort| clean and staff very helpful and kind. The choice of restaurants is wide and varied menu. Not recommended| however| the Italian one that is also the most expensive.The beach is gorgeous but unfortunately there is a major drawback here: the absurd amount of boats| scooters| speed boats etc that pass only a short distance from the shore| and tremendous speed| forcing swimmers to sit the maximum 10 meters from the shore! Truly absurd| other resorts we saw did not have this inconvenience and so the other beaches around the isle. Breakfast OK.,Milan| Lombardia| Italy,15-01-14,No,4
Awesome Place,Had been here for our Honeymoon in Nov'13. This is an awesome piece of property with breath taking views. We had a warm welcome at the reception. Had booked a Beach front Pool Suite Room which was heavenly awesome. Just too good. Had a welcome champagne as part of the honeymoon offer. The stay was very nice and pleasant. There are a number of dining options covering almost all the wide varieties possible. The only pain is that we need to book in advance. The whole hotel is covered by buggy carts by which they will pick and drop you if you want. The boat house also needs to be booked for water sports but the boat house guys are really helpful.Overall we had a really pleasant and a wonderful stay. Was very awesome place.,Mumbai| India,12-01-14,No,5
Well worth the journey,We spent new year 2013/14 here with our children. It was our first trip to Mauritius and we we looking forward to some winter warmth. The resort is on the opposite side of the island to the airport which is a further 1hour 20mins after a long flight which we could have done without. When we arrived we were exhausted. We went straight to our suite| which was lovely. 2 bedrooms well spaced apart| 2 bathrooms and 3 showers (including an outdoor one). We were initially nervous when we realised the sheer scale of the place - so many hotels / resorts seem to fail at scale. That afternoon the person who cleaned our room introduced themselves to us and explained they would take care of our suite for the whole holiday and asked us if we had any special preferences - a really nice touch.However - when we went to the buffet restaurant for the first time| we were stunned at the quality of the food and the friendliness of the service. Buffet normally means pre-prepared food under hot lamps. Here - virtually all dishes were cooked in front of you. No expense was spared with incredible sea-food and all sorts of salads| fruits| meats and fishes.There are 6 restaurants in all. All of them have authentic chefs and change their menus every 3 days. One of our complaints about spending any length of time in a resort is the desire for a change of scene / cuisine. Here| there was never a need to leave the resort (although we did feel guilty for seeing so little of the island).All suites and villas are well spaced and the feeling of seclusion and privacy is extremely well achieved through grouping of about 10 villas around their own pool. No room is more than about a minute's walk from the main beach - a 2 mile bay of beautiful coconut palmed white sand beach with a reef about 200m from the beach.Each day we took our 6 and 4yr old snorkelling on the reef - initially beach side an then ocean side. It had taken a battering from a cyclone but was still beautiful with all the typical tropical fish| eel and snake varieties. The resort also has 6 tennis courts a huge gym| table tennis tables and all sorts of other activities. Quite often the owner would approach you at lunch or dinner| just to check how your stay was and whether everything was working out as you had planned.All staff were excellent. Any special requests that cropped up were always handled impeccably and nothing was too much trouble.The only disappointment was the kids club. Whilst the staff in there were all friendly enough and it seemed well equipped| it operated more as a holding pen than proactively engaging children and getting them all to play together. They spent most of their time handling boisterous children and so we didn't use it after the first time. However| the babysitters are happy to meet you at the restaurants and then take your children back to your villas which worked perfectly.All in all it was the best family holiday we have had to date and worth the gruelling flight with small children. But then for the price| it should have been.,Exeter| United Kingdom,10-01-14,No,5
Great family holiday,We had a great family holiday in Trou aux Biches in August 2013. The rooms have all been refurbished and have a walled outdoor shower as well as an indoor one. Staff were all very friendly. There were lots of activities for the children to do.Food was excellent.,Newcastle upon Tyne| England| United Kingdom,07-01-14,No,4
Perfect wedding destination 2013,Thank you to all of the staff for making our wedding an amazing occasion which took place in the restaurant area of the La Caravelle overlooking the beach. Jerome inspired us with ideas for our big day together with the guidance of Fatima Chuttoo. Our beach party in the evening completed the day with the resident band| a saxophonist| pianist| and two singers. Sorry we have forgotten the bands name but they were truly amazing. If Jerome could please send us details we would love to add them to the review.I would also like to thank my makeup and hair stylist who was very patient and wanted to ensure that I was happy with my makeover for the day. You achieved this tenfolds| thank you. If you are looking to get married in Mauritius you should strongly consider this hotel.,London| United Kingdom,05-01-14,No,5
Perfect| perfect| perfect,I have travelled a lot| but I have never been to a place like this in my life. Complete and utter paradise. Beach is beautiful| people are friendly| every last detail of the rooms are thought through thoroughly. I would recommend anybody to stay here. Food is pricey| however| you get what you pay for| and every meal was superb!,Halesowen| United Kingdom,04-01-14,No,5
Avoid at all costs!!,"If you've ever wondered what it feels like for a corporation to treat you as their own personal ATM| then book a few nights at Trou Aux Biches “resort” and get ready to get fleeced!While our entire stay was marked with the hotel attempting to extract cash at every possible moment| nothing topped our last few moments at the hotel that were spent talking with their GM who was desperately bargaining with us to try and get us to give him a few dollars extra after the hotel had erroneously left a 330 Euro charge on our bill (we had prepaid). In our case the extra 330 Euros they tried to get out of us for our two night stay was just the last line in a never ending barrage of shameless money grabs by the hotel. Want to play tennis? Sure| the courts are free| the rackets are free| but you need to BUY tennis balls at 11 Euro a sleeve.Want some water? No| no| no| don’t drink it from the tap they say! Just fork out a nice 3 Euro a bottle whenever thirst might call.If you would like to pay 30% more for your taxi then by all means have concierge book it for you rather than doing it yourself. I felt like a peasant trying to look for help from a noble man| whenever I needed to ask a hotel staff member for help.To be fair| their beach is beautiful and their staff who work by the water are nice. You will be harassed by a hawker every 90 seconds while enjoying the stunning view on the beach| but that might not put you out too much.My wife and I booked a last minute trip to Mauritius and stayed for two nights at Trou aux Biches. We arrived from the airport where one of the hotel staff had us wait for about 25 minutes for the most laborious check in I have ever endured. After waiting for 10 minutes| signing something then waiting for another 10 minutes the gentleman at reception walked over and finally finished off our check-in by deducting 250 Euros from our credit card for “incidentals”. A golf cart took us to our room and we settled in for our stay.For dinner that first night none of their dining options looked that appealing (I’m sure they all serve good quality food| but not one place seemed to have any sort of authentic atmosphere). We planned to go to a local restaurant down the road from the hotel. The hotel's taxi driver| who was going to take us the 10km to Grand Baie (charging 15 Euros each way for the 10 min drive) deemed our choice of restaurant too plebeian and begged that we consider a much more posh location. He basically refused to take us somewhere that he didnt think was befitting of what he saw was a fancy hotel. The restaurant he selected was fine| but when we finally escaped the clutches of the hotel the next day and walked down the road to find a venue of our own we enjoyed much better cuisine at half the price. There were was not a single instance of interaction with their staff when it didn't feel like they were angling to add a charge to our room or get us to buy something more. The hotel tries to bill itself as offering some sort of ""package""| and they do indeed offer some free watersports and beach activities. The activities were nice| but nothing that any other hotel in Mauritius doesn't offer.And then the coup de gras. The hotels magnum opus. We'd just finished a game of tennis and were laughing about the ridiculous 11 Euro charge for the balls. My wife and I were joking that we were lucky to be leaving as finally there was nothing more the hotel could add to our bill. But we were sadly wrong.When we went to check out the lady behind the desk| without speaking a word to us and while talking to another hotel guest on the phone slid a bill in front of us that included two room charges totaling 330 Euros. She explained that the hotel had tried to send us a message in our room via our TV to let us know about this charge on top of the 450 Euros we had already prepaid (we don't watch TV and never turned the thing on) but that there was nothing she could do. We had made a mistake when booking and while we listed both of our names| it still said it was just for one person. And despite the fact that no one mentioned this at check-in| no one mentioned it either day when I called the front desk| and worst of all...despite the fact that in reality we really should have paid 50 Euro extra when booking to have it listed as 2 people| the hotel wanted 330 Euros.The manager finally came over about 30 minutes later (it turned out he had been standing there the whole time). He explained that he realized the hotel had made a mistake| that someone should have mentioned the charge to us| but he kept on standing by the fact that they sent a message to our TV. He kept on saying that he was willing to work something out about this charge| but that he ""needed to get something too"". I was in a state of shock at this point. I just never imagined in my life that a hotel that tries so hard to be so fancy could stoop down so low to try and squeeze anything they could out of my wife and I. In the end I offered up the 50 Euros more so just to get the man and his entire greedy hotel to go away. I hate myself for doing that but we had another hotel to get to and it was the price I had to pay for making the mistake of trusting this hotel.In a sense| rather than focus on making your stay luxurious and pampered| the hotel seemed to have an ethos that they wanted to make guests feel rich by charging them ridiculous sum of money at every possible moment. We left and went on to another part of Mauritius for a fabulous stay and all in all would recommend the island for a good beach holiday.Just never| ever consider staying at this awful place.",Beijing| China,31-12-13,No,1
Luxury in Paradise: better than the Brochure| best destination for Heaven,Best holiday we have ever had (and we travel a lot!): The Trou aux Biches exceeded all our expectations but the most impressive part of our stay was the staff. We have been in many luxury hotels around the world but the service we experienced here was the best ever received: wherever you go in the hotel| people are very keen to make you feel at home| happy and relaxed. We were amazed by the quality of facilities (the hotel was refurbished 3 years ago)| the number of activities (it is not only a fabulous hotel and beach)| the delicious food. We enjoyed the live music every night with very talented singers and musicians. The standard rooms are very big| confortable and luxurious with WIFI everywhere| inside and outside shower. The suites are particularly great with private swimming pools on the beach. The hotel is very huge but remains exclusive.  Food was some of the best we have had on holidays in the 6 restaurants: one buffet restaurant (highest quality which is rare for a buffet)| one sea food| one thai (they prepared a special menu for our diet)| one Indian (a famous musician in the restaurant| very nice place and incredible food)| one Italian (a proper one!) and one French restaurant (as we like!). The breakfast is a great moment too. Relaxing holidays but lots of activities too: water ski station| fishing| catamaran| tennis| table tennis| aqua gym lessons| fitness center| exhibitions... time was flying over there!Clarins spa: we booked a massage and ended there everyday| the staff is very good and qualified| and coupled with breathtaking setting| that gave us a unique experience that truly blew us away!! We were treated like VIPs everywhere. We wish we could go there again every year. Thanks again to the staff and management| you made these 10 days unforgettable.,London| United Kingdom,31-12-13,No,5
Great time in Mauritius,We enjoyed 10 beautiful days - beach pool suites are great and have fantastic view to beach and sunset! Suites are large| modern and with nespresso coffee machine. Bathroom is spaceous with outside and inside shower. Double lavabo and large bathtub. Outside pool is large enough to cool off or jump in if you are to lazy to walk the down to the beach.Food is good - Thai restaurant highly recommended. Indian was ok but not the best Indian I ever had. Italian has good offers and worth to try. - plenty of sports opportunities - tennis courts and gym at top shape! nice sandy beach! Pool might not the largest we have seen but fine to cool off. Super friendly staff everywhere.Not much around to do| but hotel offers plenty of excursion in case you want to explore the island.We spent 10 days at the hotel and enjoyed it very much. Weather was great at times very hot.Hotel was not full and therefore no stress to get space at beach or in the restaurants,Zurich| Switzerland,28-12-13,No,5
Unexpected haven,First time I have written a review| I should have done this sooner. We were there July 2013.After an unbelievably horrendous and tiring flight| the huge relief to be met by such warm and welcoming staff was overwhelming. We originally booked a 2 bed villa with pool but were upgraded to a 3 bed instead - a lovely surprise ! Unknown to us every morning we were served breakfast in our villa| so no need to rush to get down to the restaurant. We had Poonan every day between - I think| 8 am and 3pm. She made no noise when she arrived and your favourite cuppa ready for you as soon as you stirred. She made our stay special| she organised and booked all evening meals and anything else we wanted and all with a polite and genuine smile| infact it took me a bit of time to get used to not washing or even rinsing my cup !I found all the staff like this- they could not do enough for you- really. We even were greeted by name whilst walking in the resort| not just a good morning| the staff made it there business to know and regularly visited us in the villa to see that everything was to our satisfaction| all done In an unobtrusive polite manner. Service and management was second to none !Our children were well catered for| children's club and teen club all great| however the highlight for them was the water sports and activities| especially the water and wakeboard skiing| the staff were all professional and even managed to have some fun with our children| all without compromising safety.Accommodation was modern| clean and well equipped and we all slept like logs every night.The spa which my husband and I both used| again first class| I would have liked to have been able to book an appointment with my young daughter| although I do realise that young children could potentially ruin the atmosphere.-maybe something for the future.Food again| first class absolutely anything you wanted and cooked the way you wanted.The only negative| which nothing can be done about was the weather| a little cool| unfortunately July is the only time we can travel. On a positive note it is not humid then.A truly memorable holiday| at this time the best one we have had and look forward to going back.,Aberdeen| United Kingdom,28-12-13,No,5
Legendary Hotel,On an average area of 40|000 Mt sq| Trou aux Biches keeping the name of the village is a 5 star Hotel Spa of the leading Beachcomber Group since years has been reinovated last year to keep up the high class service. At the main entrance| you have to push a deep breath admiring the decorations of this period of evolution..The rooms better say are displayed to meet the classy guest's expectations. A huge Garden with exotic plants| flowers| A professional charming welcome that makes you dream for a lifetime stay. Unfortunately every stay has an end but surely this complex has known an incomparable amount of Repeated Guests. I know some who were there 21 years before..Even in this competitive no need to compare the price for your stay. The challenge does not exist..Don't lose time. Enjoy your stay| We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy new year 2014..SJ,Bel Air,23-12-13,No,5
Incredible Holiday| Hotel is World Class,"The upgraded hotel is incredible. We stayed in a family suite and it was spacious and luxurious. Outdoor showers etc...Beach is the best on the island by far| and after staying at a few other hotels on the island| this is the best i've been at. Staff are very friendly and accommodating and the kids club and ""Teens club"" did a great job with our little ones. The gym and sports facilities are 5 star! I enjoy working out wherever i travel and for a holiday resort| you won't find any better. And with a golf course being built just 5km away (ready by 2015) it gonna be even better.Food was solid| and good variety (6 restaurants.) I did get let the beach vendors know that i didn't wanna be buying anything| but unfortunately the hotel cannot prevent the locals selling stuff| its politics... Water sports were well run and well organised and skiing for the little kids was brilliant on a special modified ski so my 6yr old daughter was skiing like a champion! One of the best pizza places i've ever eaten at was just a short walk from the hotel (Chez Marco) and that was a popular place to grab lunch (since we were on half board.) It was very reasonable and i enjoyed getting out of the resort to explore some local haunts.) Can't wait to go back!",Durban| South Africa,19-12-13,No,5
Good,The food is very good and as is the food. The hotel full of activities on the beach with wonderful service. The Indian and Thai restaurant has a rule that you have to be over 12 years old to be there.,London| United Kingdom,18-12-13,Yes,5
Very nice hotel but not quite 5 star,Extremely large resort but excellent landscaping meant it never felt big or overcrowded. We stayed 12 nights in a tropical junior suite| the room was more than sufficient and also had an outside shower (although we tended to use the indoor shower most of the time). Cleaning of the room was unfortunately not very good.There was a choice of 6 restaurants but can only really recommend 3 (le caravelle| the Indian and l'oasis). We decided to book the full board plus package which worked out quite well for us. Had breakfast everyday at le caravelle which was very nice and also had lunch here most days - 2 courses plus drinks were included in our package and the portions were very generous. Tried Le deck for lunch once but that was very disappointing as was the Italian that we tried for dinner on 2 occasions. The staff at Le caravelle and the Indian restaurants were definitely worth 5 stars and were very good at catering for people with food allergies. Note that even though the hotel appeared to have very few guests| we had to book tables for dinner at the non-buffet restaurants at least 2-3 days in advance. Beach was very nice| but like the rest of Mauritius it was public so open to locals trying to sell their wares - not a big problem and a simple 'no thank you' was sufficient to send them on their way. There was never a problem finding a sun lounger and we also spent quite a bit of time by the pool which we had to ourselves most of the time (apart from the Mosquitos towards the end of the day!). Went snorkelling with one of the hotel boats (free of charge) which was ok but not quite the variety of fish we have seen in other parts of the world. We booked 2 excursions directly with the hotel| both of which were excellent. The first was with 'doslwim'| a combined dolphin and whale watching trip. Dolswim were very respectful to the marine life unlike a lot of the other boats we saw. You are pretty much guaranteed seeing dolphins - we saw at least 100 - and being able to swim alongside them was an amazing experience. We were told we had a 70% chance of seeing whales and were lucky enough to see a number of sperm whales which was fantastic. The other trip we did was quad biking in the south of the island (frederica nature reserve) which was a lot of fun and a good way of seeing a different side of this beautiful island - highly recommended (but not for people suffering with a bad back as the ride is a bit on the bumpy side). Note that the cost of each excursion was approximately 100 pounds per person including private transfer from the hotel.,Oslo,23-11-13,Yes,4
POOR MANAGEMENT| POOR SERVICE| BUT GREAT BEACH FRONT SUITE WITH POOL !,My wife| our 8 years old son and myself spent 4 nights in Beachcomber Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa| from 20-24.10.2013. We stayed during the first night in the Beach Front Suite with Pool number 455 (to avoid at all costs !!!) and immediately changed the next night for the Beach Front Suite with Pool number 103 (a much better choice !).This hotel can give you the Best but also the Worst... Upon arrival| we were waiting| waiting and waiting to be checked in| when finally I decided to go myself to say that we were waiting for a check in process and that nobody was coming to us| very bad start... Finally a woman came from reception and gave us| I should say| the worst possible Suite of the hotel ! Once there| we found out that it looked great inside the Suite| but very dirty outside| close to our private pool. Why ? Because this Suite nbr 455 is located just under a big tree| which gives shadow until 2-3 pm making the pool remaining cold| because leaves from this tree are falling non stop either on the terrace or inside the pool (not being cleaned regularly)| because birds are coming on the tree and take our terrace for toilets| making a lot of dirty things all around and last but not least| because there are frogs around the pool| which make a tremendous noisy sound| especially when the night starts| not giving you any chance to sleep| noise being really strong !!! So| unable to fall asleep| we called reception and asked them to do something against those frogs| but of course| nobody came and nothing was done| so the next day we came to reception and gave them 2-3 Suites numbers that we could stay in| as long as no frogs would kill our remaining 3 nights as they did. We received a new Suite but not a single compensation for the nightmare night... Poor Management reaction...However| if you decide to stay inside this hotel| you must take a Suite with sea view| it definitively worths it fully. Sunset from your terrace on every evening| close to the beach| nice palm trees all around| mini bar service passing in front of your Suite with a little electrical car| etc. We found out that the hotel was big| really too big ! Even if occupancy was turning around 45-50%| we had the feeling that hotel was full ! People everywhere| kids everywhere| beach over crowded by tourists| locals and worst of all| by many local people trying to sell you their things| which nobody needs or wants. It is now like this in front of almost all hotels in Mauritius| we faced the same problem in Le Paradis and in Le Royal Palm| it's really disturbing clients| who are looking for quiet| peaceful and relaxing holidays. Nobody likes to be disturbed 5-10 times per day by those intrusive sellers.Last but not least| we found out that the level in the quality of the service provided in Trou aux Biches was much lower than we expected !!! Service in restaurant Oasis was very slow| nobody is picking up your plate once you have finished| your glass of water or wine will also not be filled in| there were almost always something missing on the tables (spoon| sugar| salt| etc.). Same problem in La Caravelle restaurant| for breakfast. As it was a lot of birds dejections on chairs| birds walking on tables and eating in your plate| a lot of flies all around| no ketchup| mustard or nutella available (you had to ask a waiter for this...)| and slow service.Well| to resume our stay| it was a major disapointment for us| coming from Le Paradis where everything was just perfect and going after to Royal Palm where everything was just better. We will not come back to Trou aux Biches| even if the beach is great and the Suites are excellent| the points mentionned earlier are enough for us not to have to support them during our holidays| so let's say that :Positive Points :--------------------1) Beach is very nice| long with many palm trees.2) The main pool is great| attractive| nice| well almost excellent !3) Suites are just amazing| large| comfortable and well located.Points to be improved :-----------------------------1) Poor Management attitude| we never saw neither the Director| nor his assistant. Not a single compensation for the loss of our 1st night due to frog. Nothing was done in the next days to catch the frogs by the way...2) Very slow service inside the restaurant Oasis and Caravelle during breakfast an dinner.3) Lack of follow up when problems arise| frogs are still around Suite nbr 455...4) Too big hotel with too many people around| you miss privacy.5) Locals selling their thing all along the beach| disturbing the clients.6) Very agressive mosquitos in the area| it was not like this in Le Paradis or Royal Palm. Not enough anti-mosquitos treatments are done.Well| that's it. I will soon add some photos and videos which you will see either on this site or on internet.So| good luck if you want to stay in this hotel| avoid Suite nbr 455 and avoid high season ;-). Please also note that the Manager is the same guy since 30 years| so if he lost somehow his motivation| it seems his staff also lost their motivation| maybe to change the Manager to improve the service ???,Geneva| Switzerland,12-11-13,Yes,2
Heaven,Me and my wife came here for our honeymoon. We had such a good time and it really was heaven. I'm a hard guy to please but this place met all expectations and more. The food is fantastic and can not be be faulted. A pricey holiday but a once in a life time experience .,yeovil,11-11-13,Yes,5
Good Service and Nice Location,I stayed at this property with my wife and child| and it was very pleasant. the service is extremely wonderful and the property is beautiful. I was extremely pleased with the food quality there| as it exceeded my expectations.the hagglers at the beach were annoying though| which made me spend more time at the villa pool.,Riyadh,03-11-13,Yes,4
A glorious piece of beach,This hotel is stunning. The layout and set-up really are awesome. Perhaps this is because it has all been newly rebuilt| but it just works. A few of the many highlights: the beds are comfy| the bathrooms are beautiful| the gardens are impeccable| the pools are stunning and the stretch of beach is clean and (despite the coral| which makes it hard to walk on for little feet|) simply endless. Some of the restaurants are incredible and well worth the extra calories! The staff are generally very helpful and friendly| despite a language barrier at times. A few cons: the restaurants fill up quickly| so it is advisable to book as early as possible. The floor boards around the pool and on the walkways are very slippery when it rains; they havent been sawn correctly for inclement weather. Swimming at the beach is really limited to a small area and there are far too many boats whizzing by. The housekeeping is not always consistent and predictable| on some days it was done early and thoroughly| on others| it was done quite late in the day and very minimally. Every one will tell you that Mauritius can be very pricy and we found this to be the case| but we took some of our own hard tack from duty free and bought mixers (and bottled water) from the local supermarket which is literally down the road (walking distance). Le Deck - the supposed seafood specialist among the six restaurants at TAB was very disappointing and overpriced. We had the 'chefs special seafood platter' and it was overcooked| minimalist and massively overpriced at around USD100. La Carvelle was amazing and when we had dinner there a-la carte| as well as lunch there a-la carte| we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. My husband and I ate Creole seafood dishes for lunch and they were outstanding. the dinner menu held real gems of Duck L'Orange and Prawns with Ravioli that were outstanding.The Pizzas are good as well. Salads quite leafy though. And the best spot for breakfast. L'Oasis was pretty good| but quite standard. Good breakfast there though and amazing staff. Blue Ginger was an amazing Thai food experience. Mahiya was outstanding. The manager| Leckraj| went out of his way to make it an incredible experience for us; even arranging special bindis for the ladies. The food was fragrant and spicy but really not hot. Delicious and the best culinary experience at the hotel. Il Corallo was also pretty amazing. Here| the manager| Anwar (I think?) was also exceptionally trained and made our evening one we will not easily forget. The menu was not predictably or traditionally Italian| but what we ate was scrumptious. The lunch time vendors on the golf carts also delivered simple| good food| along the beach. Burgers were particularly tasty. The Spa was really beautiful| although it was very full and it was difficult to make a booking. I would suggest that they extend the hours. The beauticians were polite and well trained. the Kids club offered a lovely escape to my eldest daughter| who was almost three. She went there with a nanny - who was incredible. Her name was Nazima. It was great to have somewhere to send her when the rain set in| which is sadly what happened for two days.We loved the boat excursion along the coast but due to the weather couldn't explore the reefs at all. Overall| we had a wonderful trip. We stayed in a Family suite and loved the space for our children (three years and ten months). Our colleagues stayed in a beach front suite with a pool and I am glad we were tucked away from the beach front. I felt the children were safer without a pool on our doorstep (as they cant yet swim) and also from prying eyes who can see into most of the beach front suites| although they are beautiful and very luxurious.,Pietermaritzburg| South Africa,02-11-13,Yes,5
Perfect place to relax!,I spent the honeymoon and loved the place - beautiful beach with marvelous accommodation!Resort with many activities (almost all of the value included in the accommodation)| good food and gentle people.The heaven!!!,Rio de Janeiro| RJ,28-10-13,Yes,5
September Honeymoon,My husband and I arrived on 3 September for 10 nights at Trou Aux Biches.We stayed in a Tropical Junior Suite. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. At first we thought we would regret not having a booked a beachfront suite- but as we are very private people we found that unless you were very careful about positioning| we were happy we were not in one! They face straight onto the pathway| and so privacy we feel is compromised there.The food was great| if a little bland at time for our palates. Favourites being Italian| The Deck and La Caravelle. The Indian and Thai| while lovely venues| were a little restrictive as you had to have a set menu.The beach is phenomenal| and we found the weather to be wonderfully warm| but not overly hot.We had 3 spa treatments and would highly recommend the spa! Would happily return....Overall| the staff were wonderful| and could not be faulted.,Johannesburg| South Africa,25-10-13,Yes,5
Worth every penny,I'm not going to tell you all the good things about this hotel. There is little more to say that others haven't. I am happy to agree with all contributors who have commented on the fantastic rooms| pleasant| helpful staff| superb beach and gardens etc etc.Points that I do think are worth noting are as follows:Breakfast - seems less of a bustle in La Caravelle with a beautiful view of the beachLunch - only ate once in the hotel. Instead head down the beach towards Trou aux Biches and at the Embarkation Point you will find a number of street food sellers. Most days we had a couple of dishes and a drink each for £5 - great fresh food and nice to meet and chat with locals.Dinner - Best restaurant was Mahiya (but only if you like Indian food I guess!). I was concerned before going that I would encounter many dishes with a supplement. Whilst it is true that some dishes did have a supplement| it was very easy to choose good dishes without. With regard to the supplements| I have to say some seemed a bit petty. We only had a couple and I recall the supplement was £4/5 for the dish. Given the cost of the resort it seems a little churlish. At the other end of the scale were Lobster night (by recollection a £60 supplement) and a fish platter with an £80 platter - didn't see too many people partaking.Restaurant booking - the idea is that you book restaurants in advance. When we were there the resort was quite quiet but it still put people into a bit of a spin if you just arrived to ask for a table. When occupancy is higher I guess that without booking they could not accommodate at the smaller restaurants and you would have to fall back on the larger buffet facility. There is a useful plan of which restaurant is open which day - I would advise forward planning to ensure you get your preferred choices.Excursions - went on a catamaran trip from Grand Baie. Marketed as 'lunch on a desert island'. No surprise to find that we were one of about 10 boats| each with 30-40 people aboard. It was busier than our own beach! Still a nice day out and at £40 per person including lunch and drinks| not bad value.Bar - There is no real bar at the hotel. There are two bars but you can't really sit at either. I missed the opportunity to go for an early evening beer| perhaps meet someone for a chat| watch a bit of sport etc. We did go for a drink one night around 5.30 to watch the sun go down and we were the only customers. I think the bar staff found it strange we were even there. If a bar scene is important to you - be aware.Drinks - As we were HB| almost all our spend was on drinks. As many have said| prices are on the high side. Beer at £4 for a 330ml can and £10 for a G+T seems on the high side. Again a short walk into Trou aux Biches gives the opportunity to buy chilled drinks at more reasonable rates (6 beers for around £5). If the hotel want to keep prices at this level| I can only assume they expect some to go elsewhere. Had the prices been £2 for a beer for example| not sure I would have bothered. We also took a bottle of spirits via duty free and the room has very nice glassware available. Only had to buy the tonic!The bedroom - best I have ever stayed in (junior beachfront with pool). Fantastic bathroom| large uncluttered bedroom| decking and pool to die for.Taxis - cost of taxis organised via the hotel seems high. Cost £40 for a round trip to Port Louis. I would be interested to know the cost if you went into Trou aux Biches to grab a cab.WiFi - Painfully slow to almost non existent. It is however free and I would imagine over time they will improve it.I could go on but guess those are the main points. Anything which appears a little negative above is not supposed to detract from what is a fabulous resort which truly deserves 5 stars. I would happily return at the drop of a hat.,Blackburn| United Kingdom,21-10-13,Yes,5
Heaven on Earth...,I would highly recommend this resort to anyone who wants to experience a luxurious| relaxing| peaceful holiday on a beautiful beach in an immaculate resort. We stayed in this hotel for a week in September (wish it was for longer than that) and it was recommended to us by the Governor of Mauritius. The experience from the time we set foot into the reception for checking-in to the time we checked-out was out of this world simply great. We were given drinks on arrival and sat down by the reception where the lady came to greet us and tell us about the room. We got there quite late so she explained about the restaurants and the time until which they served food. The Resort: We are vegetarian and could not really eat much in the buffet. The only place that did good Vegetarian food was the Indian restaurant called Mahiya. The manager| Fatima| was very understanding and she actually booked us for all 7 nights into the Indian restaurant. The personalisation didn't end there....the head chef of Mahiya| came over to our table on our first night and ask what our favourite vegetables/dishes were. He then prepared a special menu for us for the remainder of our nights. Call about going an extra mile for the customer...this was unbelievable. We were also given a fantastic cake on our anniversary which was an unexpected but again a very nice gesture. I cannot praise the staff at Mahiya enough as they made our stay extra special. The director of the resort| would make sure that she has a word or two with the customers| taking feedback and checking if everything was OK so she gets all the information first hand. The staff was very friendly and the level of service was excellent. The resort deserves the 5+ star rating that it has got and maybe more. The resort is very big with around 800 staff members| lot of palm trees with coconuts| I'd say 5 trees per metre probably :-). And the beauty is that it doesn't really feel that it is crowded at any given point in time. Be it at the beach| at he restaurants or at the buffet. As there is a lot of greenery around| the atmosphere is very tranquil| peaceful and calming. There is one large swimming pool for adults and kids in the centre of the resort and another 4-5 big swimming pools for every 20-30 rooms. So you will never be short of one. The Beach: We were on a beach-front villa and the views from the room were absolutely stunning and out of this world. Just waking up to that every morning made our trip worthwhile. The beach was cleaned first thing every morning which was good. There were a couple of staff members allocated to each small portion of the beach. They stand at the back all day| with a trolley full of drinks and snacks. They would move your sun lounger and offer general help without you having to ask. There is a guy called Rishi| near rooms 100-300 who was very helpful and takes great photographs :-) The room: As we were on our wedding anniversary trip| we were greeted to a bottle of wine and a basket of fruit. The room itself was in an immaculate condition. The bedsheets| towels were all very neat and clean and the room was set up to a very high standard. The size is amazing and huge glass doors give you a great view of the beach from the bed. The bathroom shower(s) were a great feature. Both the indoor and outdoor shower were great. Turn down service and the room service in general was very excellent. The plunge pool and the outside sitting area were fabulous. The water in the plunge pool was continuously being filtered so was clean and the fact that you can just sit there with a drink overlooking the sea was quite something. Mauritius: The place is amazing. We went on a guided tour with a guy called Satish. He works in the resort but does this sight seeing tours on the side as well. We went with him for a day and saw the natural beauty of the island. He was very great and I would definitely recommend doing a tour with him when you are out there. It was the best holiday that we have ever been and would definitely go back. Even now when I go to bed and wake up the scene of the beach flashes in front of my eyes.,Windlesham| United Kingdom,15-10-13,Yes,5
Angelfish travel and Trou Aux Biches- Par excellence,We booked our Honeymoon through a fantastic travel company called Angelfish Travel who are a small independent tour operator specialising in luxury travel. I dealt mainly with Sam who was fantastic| so knowledgable and helpful | 10 out of 10 Sam for patience | as I did look at several options !! We decided on a Honeymoon in Mauritius | staying at Trou Aux Biches with a few nights at the end of our honeymoon at 20 degrees sud.from the moment we arrived at TAB we loved the hotel.fantastic location |beautiful well kept grounds and a wonderful long sandy beach fringed with palm trees .we stayed in the tropical junior suite which we would recommend | very spacious indeed and well equipped.The staff at this hotel were excellent| they were always happy to help you and really were outstanding in every way | service | attitude you couldn't fault them.all in all we loved every aspect of our stay at this fabulous hotel.would we return ?.....in a heartbeat !! 20 degrees sud| that's another matter for another review.,Peterborough| United Kingdom,15-10-13,Yes,5
Amazing tropical vacation,Brace yourselves| this is going to be a lengthy review. There is a lot to say! I will start by saying we had an amazing time; from the moment we arrived to our departure. Check in and check out were a piece of cake. We were welcomed with fruit skewers/citrus drink and a fresh hand & face towel. We were seated in the lounge/lobby area and waited for the front desk to check us in.The process was quick and efficient. The check out was just as easy. They kindly let us keep our room until our transfer to another Beachcomber hotel (1pm). Our tropical junior suite was beautiful; tastefully decorated and very spacious. We had a big comfortable bed| a large desk| a chill zone with a table and two chairs|a lovely patio with a table and two sun loungers| and a big HD TV. The room's best feature was the bathroom. It had a huge bathtub| his and hers sinks| an indoor shower and an outdoor tropical shower. In one corner we had a large dressing and a safe. It was also equipped with a mini bar. We didn't take anything out of the mini bar as prices were rather high. E.g: a 5cl Bombay Sapphire bottle was 360 rp/ €8. Minor con: the very slow internet. The resort is equally beautiful. The property's impeccably groomed gardens are full of exotic plants| vast flower beds| huge palm trees. The resort underwent a makeover a few years ago and it really shows. Everything is new and shiny. There is also a crazy amount of staff on the property constantly cleaning| doing maintenance work and generally ensuring the well-being of its guests. The staff does an OUTSTANDING job; very attentive and seriously hard working. You will not meet one person who isn't willing to help you out. We were very appreciative of the amount of smiles received. Special thanks to: Natanielle (customer service)| Menon and Vinai (La Caravelle)| Hans and Sailesh (The deck)| Leckraj (Mayiha) and Didier (Blue Ginger). There's one main pool| which is by the Deck and the Oasis. However each crescent has its own pool| which maximises chances of peace and quiet. There is an abundance of sun loungers on the beach and by the pools. So no worries you won't have to fight for one.Speaking of the beach; Trou aux biches has one of the most beautiful in the world. Breathtaking. White sand and turquoise water. The staff cleans the beach in the early hours of the morning and removes the dead coral so no need for beach sandals to enter the sea. There is enough shade for everyone. You'll always find a staff member on site to order a refreshing beverage or a snack. Foodwise we were overall very satisfied. Here are our thoughts on the different restaurants:L'Oasis (International- breakfast/lunch/dinner)- buffet that offers a wide variety of cuisines. I would recommend going when they're having a mauritian night. We loved it! We discovered many delicious local dishes. Il Corallo (Italian- dinner only)- great selection of tasty antipasti| good main courses (lasagna and chicken)| dessert average (tiramisu). La Caravelle (International- breakfast/lunch/dinner)- we had breakfast and lunch there everyday. Great breakfast buffet. Lunchtime menu offers salads| pasta| pizza| paninis| mauritian/indian dishes (tandoori| curry|etc...)| vegeratian food. Never disappointed. The Deck (International- lunch/dinner)- had lunch there once| wasn't bad but wasn't memorable. However dinner was amazing. Top notch ingredients and creative cooking. Blue ginger (Thai- dinner only)- set menu. Too copious for us| which meant we didn't really savour the food and felt a bit sick by the end of the meal. Mayiha (Indian- dinner only)- set menu. The best restaurant of the hotel. We discovered many new flavours. We very much enjoyed the dining experience. Drinks are not included in the full board or half board. 1L sparking water 120 rp/€3 - 1L mineral water 100 rp/ €2.50Somes dishes have a supplement. E.g la caravelle at lunch Langouste 1500 rp/€37- Il Corallo langouste 2500 rp/€61.The hotel has a Clarins Spa. We went for a couple's massage. Lovely experience.The one and only MAJOR con was the beach vendors. The beach is public. There are 36 beach vendors roaming the beach at all time of the day. A 'no thank you' will suffice for some. Others will harrass you relentlessly. They will spot you by the colour of your pale| sun deprived skin. They will only give you prices once you've finally accepted to buy something. Once you've bought something from someone| you'll have a queue of vendors expecting you to buy something too. And when you don't| they will NOT be happy and sometimes will insult you profusely (Dani with the mustache| Anam| Lulu| Loulou). The worst one was Anam (large hat covered in fake flowers). He came to see us three/four times a day. He once chased us into the water| demanding that we get out to buy something. Even once we had bought bracelets and sea shells from him| he continued to come at us on a daily basis. He also ripped us off. But that's part of the game isn't it?The nice vendors were Morice and John with the swiss cap. We had a wonderful time and will forever remember our week at Trou aux Biches.Visited from 11-19th September 2013.,Paris| France,13-10-13,Yes,5
Internet wasn't fast enough :///////,I really enjoyed Troux aux biches and it was really scenic| but they tried to pressure me into doing activities too much and i wanted to stay in bed on my laptop. Therefore the internet really wasn't fast enough.,Basel| Switzerland,12-10-13,Yes,3
Excellent honeymoon destination| needs more veg food,Brilliant destination with one if the best beaches. However could do with more vegetarian choice. Also restaurants are not really al a cart as all the same fixed price. Rooms are amazing and the style of hotel is great.,south west,11-10-13,Yes,5
A wedding in paradise - truely fabulous experience. If you book this hotel you wont be disappointed,A fabulous time at the Trou Aux Biches hotel| where we also got married. The hotel is amazing. We booked the Luxury Wedding Package| which included lots of extras like spa treatments| make-up| 4 course meal after the wedding| champagne| personal collection to and from the airport etc. We stayed in a Beachfront Villa with Pool and it was worth the extra - you can't beat waking up to pull back the curtains and seeing the amazing view from your bed. The villa was fabulous and we loved the outdoor shower. Room service was excellent as were the restaurants. You have to book the restaurants in advance| but they are very good and food delicious and fresh. Quite a lot of choice with 6 restaurants - we had booked the Full Board Plus package and were very satisfied with the options available. Service in restaurants can be a little slow at times as each waiter seem to have their own particular job to do| but they can't do enough for you. Reception is very good - always willing to help any enquiry. The beach is stunning| as are the sunsets - sometimes the sellers walking up and down can be annoying| try not to catch their eye and you will be left alone. We didn't get to do any excursions| but if going into Grand Bay we recommend that you get the bus rather than taxi| the buses are frequent and its not a long journey (taxi's cost 100% more than bus). As for the wedding package the spa treatments were excellent and made us both feel very special - I have to thank them for the amazing make-up session| as the bride it made me feel special & beautiful - everyone back home has commented on how lovely I looked. We want to return to Mauritius as we didn't get to do enough sightseeing and there is plenty to see and do on the island. Happily stay at this hotel again or consider any other Beachcomber hotels.,south west,08-10-13,No,5

Fantastic Location| Fantastic Service,We did a LOT of research before booking our trip| and Trou aux Biches did not disappoint !It was a very special occasion for us| as we got engaged during our stay here (on my birthday). 8-)The food and beverage Manager (Gerome) pulled out all the stops in helping plan the perfect ambiance for us on the beach for me to surprise my girlfriend (now Fiancée) ;-) Music| local Mauritian dancing| privacy| romance| champagne and a phenomenal personalised menu.The staff struck the perfect balance between providing a personal service whilst being perfectly professional| giving us the personal space we needed when appropriate. The quality of the food overall and choice of restaurants was excellent. Our favourite was La Caravelle| where the presentation and quality of the food was second to none.We spent the second half of our stay in Mauritius on the East coast| and we found the weather and particularly the beach in Trou aux Biches to be a step above other areas.A huge thanks to the team for taking such great care of us (Gerome| Nathanielle| Allain| Sanjay| and Sandrine). Tips: Bring your mosquito repellent| and practice your hawker 'non merci' wave| both of which you'll use to a significant degree here| but will get used to pretty quickly. Secondly| and more importantly - take the time on arrival to book your meal reservations in advance. The restaurants are busy during high season / shoulder season| so book soon after your arrival to avoid disappointment. Summary: Would highly recommend Trou aux Biches: You're sure to enjoy your stay if you decide to book here for a romantic break away in Mauritius!,Dublin| Ireland,01-10-13,No,5
Perfect start to our honeymoon,"The Trou aux Biches was arranged by my husband for our honeymoon| it was a complete surprise where we were going and considering my lack of holiday since January to save leave for our honeymoon I was hoping for something incredible! This place did not disappoint. My review will cover overall impressions| the room and restaurants| hotel services and activities.First impressions: the hotel is three years old| so everything is immaculate. Gorgeous palms and thatched cottages line the beach. The welcoming reception staff couldn't have been any more charming. As honeymooners we were also provided with lunch (2 courses) on top of our half board already paid for. A lovely touch! Secondly we were upgraded to a senior beach front suite with a private pool.....a great start. (Tip| bring your marriage certificate to prove you are on honeymoon and go for beach front rooms) The suite (room 239): firstly it is huge 160msq! The living room and bedroom (both separate) connect to a huge deck with steps that lead down to your own pool. The bathroom is also a big as most London flats| with the largest round tub I've ever seen (my husband is 6'10"" so he was ecstatic!) The rooms both boast at least a 42"" flat screen tv. A large minibar with everything you could ever want. The bed is a king size and perhaps a bit hard for some but you get over that when you look out the glass doors at the palm beach sea view.The toiletries are excellent - they seem to understand the effect the heat has on British hair! (Re stocked generously every day)Huge wardrobes in the bathroom for you too unpack so you really feel at home.The location of this suite is right in front of the boat house and closest to the main pool| very convenient although you do hear the band at night (for us this was no issue| but if you're an early to bed person you may want a room further away) A special mention to Rambo who looked after us everyday by our pool| towels and cocktails galore. Restaurants: there are six! We tried all bar the Indian.The Thai was excellent| a set menu and lovely setting| highly recommend.The Italian| this unfortunately was not the best food but the beach side location was lovely.The deck| open for breakfast and lunch was one of our favourites| situated next to the huge pool and the beach.The Caravelle also served all meals| the staff here we're excellent| a special mention to Gunshee who was so welcoming every time we rocked up. The cocktail bar here does do excellent drinks!The L'Oasis is the main bar and buffet restaurant for all meals. The choices are extensive| something for every taste. Tip: if you want to sample all restaurants| you must book your dinner table in advance as all bar the L'Oasis need reservations| and they fill up fast as the resort is huge! Activities: the hotel provides free snorkelling| waterskiing| sailing| kayaking| aqua gym etc....book in at the boat house. There are also private companies on the beach who tout for business like swimming with dolphins| they are expensive but cheaper than the hotel| you may get a deal if you share with others.Services: as a honeymoon couple we got a half hour back massage included| the spa is beautiful and so worth the walk. (The massage only lasted 15 mins though....perhaps because we did not opt to upgrade the spa package)Tennis courts are excellent (4 hard court and 2 soft)| book in advance for a court at dusk when it's cooler.The gyms are very well kitted out with cardio and weight equipment. Overall| an excellently run resort especially considering its size! It was the perfect start to our honeymoon.",London,28-09-13,No,5
A little bit of heven,I would defiantly recommend this hotel. I travelled here with my family (a group of 8) for my mum's 60th Birthday. With a little bit of research we had found out that the hotel do not have many twin rooms for adults| therefore we contacted the hotel before hand to ensure we were able to reserve one| as well as inform them of my mums 60th birthday. They were very accommodating and ensured one was reserved for our party. When we arrived our rooms were ready and most staff already knew who we were (kind of felt like a super star| which was nice). We had four rooms allocated with one being a twin. Now to point out there is no room with two twin beds| they have a select few rooms that have their standard giant King size bed and a sofa that is converted into a second bed. However as the bed was huge we ended up just sharing the bed in the end.The hotel it self was amazing| the grounds were beautiful and the rooms were luxurious. Especially the bathrooms as they had a bath tub| an indoor open rain shower| along with an outdoor shower| which felt like you were in a tropical jungle. The beach was beautiful and never had an issue finding a sun bed especially 8 together. They had arranged a gift for my mum on her actual 60th birthday| which was a really nice surprise. As we were only on a &B basis| we had only arranged dinner in the hotel once during our stay. The restaurant décors are defiantly first class| which would explain the price tag that went along with the food. With all of us being vegetarian| the chef had arranged a special menu for us and the hotel had actually charged us less than what the standard price was| which was much appreciated. As the hotel is spread out across the beach| there is a buggy service that can take you from main reception to your rooms and vice versa (a word or warning if requesting a buggy during peak times I would ensure you leave at least 15 min for the buggy's to arrive before you wish to leave) .Overall the hotel was beyond all our expectations and I would like to thank the hotel and staff for their hospitality. I would defiantly recommend this hotel.,London| United Kingdom,28-09-13,No,5
Fantastic break in paradise,I travelled here with my family for my 50th birthday.it was a surprise and I certainly was not disappointed.The resort was beautiful| it took my breath away.The staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them.The food was excellent and very varied. We tried every restaurant whilst we were there and was never disappointed by the quality and amount of food offered.Entertainment was to a high standard and very enjoyable.My one negative point would be the cost of drinks. In my opinion they were very expensive| £5 for a child's apple juice is a little bit over the top. Other than that I loved it all and would definitely return.,Leeds| United Kingdom,27-09-13,No,5
The perfect honeymoon,We stayed at Maurtius on the occasion of our honeymoon. The hotel and staff are great! The people in Mauritius are very friendly. We loved our room (tropical junior suite) and were happy we didn't pay for a room on the beach as you have always people passing by in front of your room. The food is delicious and you have a wide variety in the different restaurants. Our favorites were the Italian and Le Deck. The full board plus package is also very good otherwise drinks can become very expensive. We also advise to do some excursions in the south of the island. We did a tour with Mauritours (Trou aux cerfs| grand bassin| Curepipe| Chamarel...) and a day on a catamaran where we saw the dolphins. The hotel has his own taxi service so one day we asked a taxi to bring us to Port Louis. The taxi waited for 3 hours and we had plenty of time to visit the city. There is still so much to tell about the hotel but I can tell you that everything was just great! If you still hesitate in choosing your hotel| then stop hesitating| this is the hotel you should book for your honeymoon!,Brussels| Belgium,26-09-13,No,5
Lovely hotel for a relaxing honeymoon,I recently stayed at this hotel for part of my honeymoon. Its a huge hotel but you don't really notice the hundreds of other guests which is a plus. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and it was so nice to be looking out over the sea while you eat. If you like large resort style hotels then I'm sure you will enjoy staying here. It does lack slightly in personality but the service is great and the rooms are spacious and luxurious.,London| United Kingdom,25-09-13,No,4
Beautiful| if a bit impersonal,"We had a fantastic honeymoon at this well appointed and almost perfectly run hotel. But to warn that it's big| with over five restaurants that look the same and serve similar type hotel food (even if with different themes). The huge Buffett breakfast keeps you full for ages so don't include lunch. The service was impeccable and efficient but lacks African warmth. And don't buy the pearls on the beach| no matter what license the guy hauls out. There is no bargain despite the great price you think you are getting. The rooms were fab and private and all amenities are on tap. Just too big for me with a ""conference"" feel to the place. Port Louis is a disappointment and to be given a skip.",Jhb,24-09-13,No,4
Fantastic setting| 5star plus rooms,Very beautiful and spacious grounds - the water features| layout and bungalows excude tranquility. Food was excellent and service great however make sure you book early at one of the six restaurants if you don't want the the buffet. The water sports that are included are hours of entertainment| however staff in this department were the only that could have been a little more welcoming and friendly. Overall| wonderful stay and would definitely be back.,Epsom| United Kingdom,22-09-13,No,5
Outstanding hotel in an outstanding location,There are so many good things about the hotel. It is on a 3 km beach of soft coral sand. The facilities are superb. The rooms are spacious| clean and well equipped. There is no real advantage to have rooms on near the beach with their own plunged pool . The sea and large main pool are so good and close there is no point in paying the extra for better rooms. All the restaurants we tried were of a high standard. Some dishes were outstanding. The staff are so friendly and very well trained. Always helpful and making you feel at home. Their name recognition made you very welcome and indicative of good training and leadership. It is a large hotel but this was not a problem. There were sufficient beach recliners that there was never any hassle. The beach is also long which is a great advantage as you can walk and not feel hemmed in by the hotel as so often happens.Some tips :* book the Indian| Thai or Italian restaurants early in your stay as they can get full. However not a major issue as the other restaurants were good* do not be put off by buffet restaurants. There were only a few prepared dishes and most freshly cooked.* the spa is expensive. There is a good massage place opposite the police station 400m from the hotel. Not the same atmosphere but a fraction of the price* taxis are easily available near the hotel and are a good way to see the island* the restaurants outside the hotel are not as good as the hotel. We went half board but still wanted to eat outside occasionally in the evening. We did once and it was not worth it.The issues with the hotel were small. The evening entertainment was poor and the bars lacked atmosphere. There were also no face towels/flannels in the bathroom.Overall an excellent hotel| better than others we have stayed in Mauritius. Expensive but worth it.,Epsom| United Kingdom,21-09-13,No,5
Could be excellent...,The Trou-aux-Biches (TAB) is very good| rather than excellent| only because it lets itself down on a small number of areas.The location| between Triolet and Grand Baie| is great| the rooms (at least in our case) fantastic| and meticulously serviced and maintained; the choice of restaurants for dinner and lunch is immense| and they all served us outstanding food. (Service in the Italian was a bit amateur| but not life-threatening).The beach| swimming pools and leisure facilities are very impressive.The main feature of this large hotel is its friendly| well-informed| well-drilled staff| who were unobtrusive| professional| personable| and genuinely excited by their work in the TAB - a fine job| by the leadership.In the 'could be better' list| I would be happy to help the TAB by discussing some shortcomings with them| rather than hang them out to dry here| but| in brief| breakfast| the bar area| and the evening entertainment| did not meet our expectations for a hotel of this standard and cost.Would we return? Well| it is worth remembering that good accommodation in Mauritius abounds and it's very competitive.,Yorkshire,20-09-13,No,4
Not the best 5 star hotel in Mauritius,I have been to Mauritius at least 50 times in the past 10 years on business and on family hols and I must say that this is the poorest 5 star hotel we have stayed at.We booked the 2 bed villa which in itself was great retreat for my wife and 2 children and only the addition of the butler/maid service made it worth the money.One benefit of the villa is that you can check in and out from the villa without having to traipse to the main building. However when checking out| we had to wait over an hour for the 'check out guy' whose machine didn't work and we had to traipse to the main building. Luckily we didn't have a plane to catch. Another advantage of the villa is that there is no check out time. So you can have the villa for the whole day.The restaurants are extremely over-priced and the food is of average quality. For example. We ordered a club sandwich thro' room service which was £ 13.50. You would expect a quality sandwich for this price. We were served a sandwich which was the size of a cigarette box| cut into 4 quarters. The sandwich consisted of a fried egg| strips of lettuce and bits of tomato and so flat that it seamed that it had been sat on. We complained and scolded the management stating that they should ashamed of themselves. They were obviously not used to customers complaining as 4 members of staff arrived within 10 minutes to apologise.We visited the restaurants on 3 nights of our 9 night stay. The other nights we went to local restaurants. Some new and some known to us. Each day we were asked about our dining arrangements for the evening so they could book the hotel restaurants accordingly. On the first occasion we decided to dine out we were recommended a local restaurant 'La prescatore' which was more expensive than the hotel (worth the money though) only to find out later that it was owned by the hotel director. They have obviously cut back on their evening entertaining budget as all they had were except for 1 night was a live band. We are used to having Indian dancers on Indian buffet night and Chinese dragons and all the decorations on Chinese nights at other 5 star hotels we have stayed at. The live band was extremely entertaining as the singer added his own comedy to the songs.The beach is extremely narrow and not exclusive to the residents (as all beaches in Mauritius). However with the locals| hawkers| dog's etc... it seemed extremely crammed. We couldn't find 4 deckchairs together so I asked a member of staff which fell on deaf ears. We had to move the chairs ourselves. Most hotels have security on the grounds but when I asked where they were I was told that they were manning the beaches. I couldn't find one when I found the hawkers using the deckchairs.I could go on but you get the general idea.,London| United Kingdom,06-09-13,No,3
Perfect in dream location,"You can look around the island and surely you will find some top hotels but this clearly ranks among the best properties in Mauritius - flawless in several aspects| stunning resort ground with lush tropical gardens| amazing pool| great breakfast buffets and of course a world class white sand beach.Rooms are extremely spacious| modern and well decorated| they even offer you a free ride on a golf cart to and from the reception (it can be quite a stretch to walk as the resort is quite big)| our villa was a mere 2 minutes walk from the beach overlooking a lovely garden and a pool.Restaurants are great but quite expensive (one must say that Mauritius feels overpriced) so instead of staying with the resort experience| save some money and make a trip to nearby Grand Baie (10 minutes by car) or the even better Pereybere Beach (15 minutes by car) with lovely small restaurants such as our favorite ""Le Benitier""- superb local food but beware that like all over the island service is slow.The best beach in Mauritius for us was the Ile aux Cerfs that you can either go explore on a boat tour or then just do like we did and drive to Trou d'eau douce (1h-1h15 drive from Trou Aux Biches) and then get a boat (around 10euros per person even if at the beginning they ask you for 25euros...) and stay there until when all tourists are gone.Other great visits in the island are the Casela Park (1h30 minutes drive) where you can pictures with small lions| cheetahs or the big lions... an unforgettable experience! Nearby you have the seakarts| that are unique in the world| allowing you to have amazing views from Le Morne and from the Crystal Rock| Belle Mare Plage (45 minutes drive)| one of the most beautiful in Mauritius| Ile aux Cocos (1h30 minutes drive) that you can take a boat from the nearby Mahebourg (7|50eur per person) but do not go for the beach in the island (pictoresque but very small) but for the snorkeling or the restaurant in the island and finally the Black river Gorges NP an Chamarel area (waterfalls| rum distillery for the best food in the island| valley of 7 colours) around 1h30 away from Trou aux Biches.Also because it was our honeymoon trip they offered us a bottle of champagne and a fruit basket- very much appreciated!Truly a wonderful island to explore- don't stay in the resort everyday!- and a great resort that I can only recommend and will look forward to stay again!!",Hamburg| Germany,01-09-13,No,5
Pricey but worth every cent,Great road to the hotel. Excellent reception. Fabulous rooms- would definitely recommend on the beach front| other rooms do not have any sea view. Beachfront suites with private pool is spacious and excellent. 6 restaurants| all have excellent food. Great beach with powder sand. All activities are available and equipment is in good condition. Watersports| gym club| tennis courts| gym classes. Good location close to Grand Baie. Facing west with beautiful sunsets. Great kids club with plenty of activities for kids and great food. The perfect balance for relaxation and water sports surrounded by lush gardens. Service is friendly and management is always keen to add value. In summary| highly recommended. ,Southampton| United Kingdom,31-08-13,No,5
Great resort| relaxing time| room for improvements,We stayed at Trou aux Biches after a safari in Kenya so were looking forward to some relaxation and sunshine. When we arrived| we were greeted by one of the reception staff and they made the checkin process quick and easy| given it was quite late evening| and we wanted to just get into our room| and get something to eat. We booked a 2 bedroom suite| which was spacious| had generous bathrooms| including outdoor shower. This was perfect for us| as our son| had his own room| with wifi and tv. The TV channels are rather limited| with no movie on demand available| which would have been nice. You can connect your laptop/iPad into the TV however. There is no wifi coverage in the restaurants or on the beach which my son would have liked...We tried all the restaurants and had mixed experience which appears to echo other reviews. We tried the Caravelle (gourmet) restaurant twice| first time was very good| second time| I had pork which was overlooked and chewy. They did try to remedy it and apologised for the quality but it did spoil the meal.Drinks are a bit overpriced for wine| starting at £25 for bottle of basic wine upwards and £10 for a pre-dinner G&T.The beach staff are very helpful| will move your lounger (heavy!) into the shade for you| and serve drinks or lunch. All the water sports are included but limited to water skiing| kayaks| pedallos| catamarans. You could do other activities such as fishing| tube rides or para sailing but these are not operated by the hotel so relies on having cash to pay the operators.Service in the restaurants can variable we felt. My wife commented that her drinks arrived after our main course was served and not until we had to chase it up| then it came once she had finished the meal. Overall food quality is good but not perhaps what you expect from a 5 star plus hotel| which is how Beachcomber present this resort. We used the gym a number of times which was always quiet and well equipped. Again| some other selection of tv channels on the gym equipment would be great| which was limited to mostly football channels| or MTV with little music playing. Most people want something to listen to or watch when working out. Overall| we had a very relaxing time and enjoyed our stay but there is room for improvement. ,Southampton| United Kingdom,30-08-13,No,4
Very nice but could be better,Resort is about 90 minutes transfer & is situated in the North East of the island. We were a family of 5 & booked two rooms for 7 nights on half board– family suite & a tropical suite| which were next to each other. Rooms are large and have nice bathrooms with indoor & outdoor showers. Family suite had an extra bedroom with two single beds and bathroom with shower. We had free Wi-Fi which was a bit slow but ok. Only disappointment was no complimentary water apart from one bottle when we arrived. Our rooms were in a very good location near to all the amenities (318 & 319) – it’s quite a large resort and some of the rooms/ villas are quite a long walk awayThe resort is on a nice sandy beach| which is quite narrow and very calm due to the reef. As the beach faces west you get lovely sunsets. Grounds are very nice as were the pool areas – especially in front of the main building towards the beach. It was quite noisy at times on the beach due to boats passing all the time quite close to the shore. It’s a public beach but this did not bother us.Hotel has 6 restaurants| one being a buffet which was also where we had breakfast. Breakfast was ok but lacking in typically English products. We ate at all the restaurants once and the buffet twice so it was our favourite. As we were on half board| you could choose a la carte| but the choice was limited and there were a lot of extra cost items. Overall| we thought the food quality was only ok.Leisure facilities were very good - I used the gym| spin class & tennis - you had to buy your own tennis balls and water| which was not good! Water sports were good and not very busy.You can walk out to Trou aux Biches which is ok – there are a few shops| restaurants and a small supermarket. We also went to Grand Baia & Port Louis| the capital which is about 20 minutes in a cab.Overall| we had a good time but the service was slow at times and most of the staff were not overly friendly. I thought this let down our overall stay and is probably why I’ve only given it 4 stars.,manchester,29-08-13,No,4
Picture postcard beautiful,"We spent 10 nights for a birthday special treat. Loved that the whole decor is rustic and in keeping with the beach environment| lots of wood. The outdoor showers are very cool| in fact the whole suite was huge and had the most amazing view from the bed. It was bliss to wake up in the morning and look out at the palm trees and see the rare birds. I did have a small ""issue"" with the electrics on the light switches so not sure if this is something that needs to be addressed in some rooms.The water-sports at the hotel are (mostly) complimentary & very generous. Both my children tried water-skiing| aged 3 and 15 and loved it. We also used the pedalos & kayaks all at no extra cost. We recommend for a trip the Dolphin and beach BBQ experience. A good chance to see the South side of the island too. Beautiful.The food in the buffet is first class. If you like seafood prepare to be spoilt as there is more than you could imagine including sea urchins| oysters| crab. It's good to try the Al La Carte restaurants too but I would say if you are with a family stick to the buffet| it's more than you need! We were on a half-board basis. We stayed in July which is Winter in Mauritius| so if you are thinking of a trip during UK summer be aware of this. Sun goes down at roughly 6pm| however the weather is still warm and we all had great tropical tans. As it's off-peak the main benefit is the hotel is fairly quiet. One day.....I shall return to the beautiful island of Mauritius and would definitely go back to Trou Aux Biches.",Edinburgh| United Kingdom,28-08-13,No,5
Idyllic,Lovely hotel in an idyllic spot. Some service problems and room issues in our first 24hrs so I decided to go straight to management as I didn't feel I was getting anywhere with the reception desk. Fatima was fantastic and from then on we received 5* treatment. Special thanks to her and also to Jerome| the food & beverage manager | for making our stay very special. The hotel & grounds are beautiful. The restaurants we particularly liked were the Caravelle and the Indian. Family suites were lovely but beach front senior suite was fantastic! We had a very relaxing stay and would definitely return to this hotel.,London| United Kingdom,27-08-13,No,4
Wonderful| Amazing| Perfect!,We have just returned from 16 night stat at Trou Aux Biches where we celebrated our wedding. We cannot say how much the hotel go to every length to make sure not only your wedding day| but entire stay at the resort| is nothing other than perfect. We spoke to other couples/families whilst there and they were all of the same opinion. The staff are friendly| attentive and professional. Special mention to Teelasha who ensured every request was met (and there was quite a lot!). We met regularly to discuss the day and it really was the most stress-free thanks to her help and advice. Fatima| the manageress| can always be seen around the resort making sure guests are happy and enjoying their stay.To anyone thinking of having their wedding here| you are in safe hands! We wouldn't hesitate in recommending their services. We would also like to mention Jerome (Food & Beverage Manager) for ensuring our wedding party enjoyed the most wonderful meal. There are 6 restaurants on site| all of which serve the most beautiful food which you enjoy in idyllic settings. We had our meal in La Caravelle the night of the wedding. We can't decide which restaurant is our favourite as each was amazing. There is a range of entertainment on nightly and we enjoyed music from live bands| a dj| fire show| sega dancers. Sandro| the Entertainment Manager| ensured we had the music we wanted to make our wedding special. We had a guitarist who played for the ceremony and for our guests at the Oasis bar whilst we had our photographs taken around the resort. TAB is a huge resort and v peaceful. The gardens are beautiful and so well maintained - we have some beautiful photographs taken in the grounds of the resort. It is possible to actually have a pool in one of the crescents almost to yourself| it's that big! We had the Junior Beachfront suite with pool which was right on the beach and it truly was bliss waking up each morning and stepping out into such a view. This suite was huge! Plenty of space to rush around the morning of a wedding! The Clairns Spa is also a must - we had a couples massage twice and on the day of the wedding my hair and make up was done by Olivia. As part of our package| we also enjoyed treatments including a body scrub| manicure and pedicure. Sunsets at TAB are also a must see. The hotel is well serviced by taxi which we found to be reasonably priced - close proximity to Grand Baie and Port Louis. A definite trip is the sunset catamaran cruise which we booked for our wedding guests as a thank you. This isn't offered at the hotel but can be booked locally. TAB offers a range of watersports which are free and great fun. There are so many memorable moments from our holiday. We couldn't have asked for more with this hotel - we look forward to our next visit!,Liverpool| United Kingdom,27-08-13,No,5
Fantastic location and activities| food is not great,My wife and I are just back from 9 days in Trou aux Biches resort and spa. We thought we would go somewhere nice for our first wedding anniversary.We booked our flights + bed and breakfast reservation through Expedia| just a couple of days before our departure from London. Most people seem to be on Half or Full board there as that's what the hotel sells. We asked how much it would cost to be upgraded to half board and we got told it would be roughly 100 pounds per day for 2 people which sounded really expensive. But| they said we could always change our mind whilst there and upgrade afterwards. So| we decided to wait and see.When we arrived there| we were really impressed by the location: the beach is amazing| the rooms are great| the swimming pool is impressive. There are lots of activities you can do for free: hobicat sailing| wind surfing| tennis| water skiing ... I think you have to pay for Tennis lessons but for the rest they teach you how to do it! You may need to book a few days in advance to get a slot for a teaching lesson as it's quite busy. There is a lot to do and between all these activities| the beach and the swimming pool| it's hard to get bored.The rooms have a good size with a balcony| rain shower| bath tub| air conditioning| big tv wifi etc. The service is very discreet and efficient. I found the mattress very hard and uncomfortable though. I spent a really bad night on it on the 2nd night| I mentionned this to the staff which came and added some padding to the bed to see if that would improve my sleep. It didn't. They asked me the next day how I had slept and after I told them that I didnt sleep much better| they added another mattress on top on the original one to see if that would improve it. They really tried hard but by that time my back was already gone and I never had a good night sleep. Thankfully| I made up for it on the beach :-) Other point I wanted to mention| it looked like the hot water was running a bit out of steam in the morning - I like my showers really hot but I could never get much heat in the am. Evening was fine.Regarding food| as we were in b&b formula| we decided to have a try and decide what to do then. I must say we were disappointed by the quality of the food. There are a few retaurants in the hotel: buffet (no reservation required)| thai and indian (set menu| reservation required)| italian and international (a la carte| reservation required). Worth saying that even if you are in half/full board| lots of dishes have a supplement if you have them. We decided to stay in b&b formula in the end.The buffet and set menus are all 1900 rupees per person which is 38 pounds. That's not cheap. And to be frank| not worth it. We tried the buffet the first night: food was ok| reasonably diverse but not amazing| obviously you can eat a lot and that's probably what you pay for. We tried the Thai menu a few days later: starters and soup were good| mains were average: the chicken had a sauce which tasted slightly burnt| the pad tai was not good. Dessert was basic. We had reserved the indian restaurant for the next day but canceled it after this experience.We tried the 2 a la carte restaurants: the international one was good. Fish curry and chinese style fish and vegetable. Again not cheap but good. Last night we tried the Italian and I must say I got really disapointed. Starter was ok| my wifes pasta and clams was decent| I ordered fish and vegetable papillote and it was terrible. The fish was tender but the dill flavouring wasn't super exciting or tasty. The vegetables were watery and very few. Not much taste to them. The menu seemed to suggest there would be olives in the dish (unless I misread): there was one. The chef came to ask us what we thought about his cooking: I explained what I thought. He apologized| the manager came later to apologize as well: they didn't charge for the dish and offered us sweet wine to make up for it.For the other nights we went to the village and had food in local restaurants. There is a good pizzeria called Chez Marco which we strongly recommend. La Marmite Mauricienne is decent and cheap. There is not much out there though| maybe there is more in high season.Breakfasts were good in my opinion although service was a bit random. You can have crepes every morning (the kids will love that!) and if you are looking for Nutella around| you will have to ask for it| seems like they are hiding it under the counter ;-)Overall| on food| I think people with half/full board formulas may not mind too much about it as the money is already gone but when you pay as you go and realize the cost/quality ratio of what you pay for| this looks very overpriced and I don't think it deserves a 5 star rating. The hotel takes advantage from the fact that there aren't many alternatives to their food around.Apart from the food| we did have a very good time there| I still recommend Trou aux biches. Just wanted to share our experience.,Worcester| United Kingdom,26-08-13,No,4
Perfect holiday| top five in Mauritius definitely,It was our first stay at the Trou aux Biches and we were blown away by the welcome| the hotel landscaping and grounds| the service| the staff| the suite which felt rather like a villa| the food and restaurant choices and the manager| Fatima| who went out of her way to make all guests feel welcome and have a fantastic stay. Thank you Gerard for the crepes in the morning| and the smile that always came with it| the buffet was exceptional| everything fresh| tasty and straight to the point| the Indian restaurant was amazing. Although the Indian and Thai restaurants are only open to adults| there is one family night a week so we managed to eat there. It was an excellent idea. The hotel went above and beyond anything we expected. The only disappointment was that there were no complimentary water bottles at turn down,Paris| France,23-08-13,No,5
Paradise,It has already been said I think. We have just spent 2 weeks here with our teenage boys and being closer to paradise is hard to imagine. Our junior suites were large and very comfortable with bathrooms big enough to party in. The bird song in the mornings was great to wake up to. The gardens are a delight with grass leading to the waters edge. We have never eaten so well on holiday. 6 restaurants to chose from and the buffet got the best vote .The choice of food was formidable both for breakfast and dinner. The beach is a stunner with its white sand and palm trees and very comfortable loungers. There is a very well run boat house which organises all the water sports and boat trips. Our boys became very competent hobycat sailors. On the day of our wedding anniversary the dolphins were in and our long held wish to swim with them (or close to them) was granted. Magical! All the staff were delightfully polite from the managers to the gardeners and maids. None more so than the main hotel manager Fatimah who was everywhere and who made it her business to ensure that all her guests were being properly looked after .It is difficult to imagine a more perfect setting with a hotel that delivers on everything!,Wiinchester,22-08-13,No,5
Tropical paradise,My husband and I have juts returned from a short break here after a safari in South Africa. It was brilliant. Choose a beach villa it is well worth it. You get your own pool which is lovely after swimming in the sea.You can watch the sunrise and sunset over palm tree fringed Indian ocean from your bed ! The beach is the best in Mauritius and the hotel grounds are a tropical botanical gardens. Villa was spacious and well set out. The outdoor shower was fabulous. Staff are friendly and helpful and with 6 restaurants to choose from you can't go wrong. The Italian restaurant was especially good with wonderful food and service. Spa was a fantastic experience and my husband loved the snorkelling in the crystal clear coral waters. Wished we could have stayed longer !,Solihull,20-08-13,No,5
"Not what I expected from a ""5+ star"" resort...very disappointing!","I think this admittedly wordy email I just sent beachcomber sums it up:--------------------------------Dear Sir/Madam|I am writing to convey my disappointment at my stay at Trou Aux Biches over the past few days. I am taking the time to write detailed feedback to you in the hope that you take it seriously and improve upon the things I found lacking| so that future guests may have a better time.First| some of the positive aspects of my stay:- The property is very beautiful| and the beach is one of the nicer ones I have seen. I enjoyed that very much.- The quality of the food was by-and-large quite good.- There are some great watersports that I enjoyed| and the boathouse staff was courteous and helpfulNow| some of the issues I encountered:Before the BookingI filled out the online form on your website on July 20| requesting some help in picking the right property for my wife and I to stay at. I got an email stating that the office was closed until 22 July. I expected someone to respond when the office re-opened. Unfortunately| no one did and I had to pick TAB myself. The Room- Within 15 minutes of entering the room| I noticed four things wrong:1) The Media Center was not working. I called for 2 different HDMI cables but neither worked with my laptop. Finally| the IT person had to come the next morning and replace the *other* cable (connecting the center to the TV)| before it worked2) The safe was not working. Someone had to come and fix it3) The flush was not working. It would keep going on and on without stopping. I did not report this as by then I was tired of attending to so many issues.4) There was a sound of a pump next to the room that was quite loud| and I could only bear to sit if I kept the bathroom door closed. Surely you can get better soundproofing?It is not acceptable for a ""5+ star"" resort| as you position yourselves| to have so many things wrong in one room!The StaffI found the staff just ""okay"" for a five star resort. At check-in| I thought the person was a little bit rude. When I misunderstood her statement| and incorrectly told my wife that the staff would show us the restaurants| she (the staff) cut me off saying| ""No| I will not SHOW you| I will only explain to you."" I thought she could have stated the same thing a little bit politely.The person who showed us to our room was helpful| but was virtually standing on my head asking for a tip. I did not expect this at a classy resort| and this is the first time it has happened to me (of course| at city hotels or business hotels| it is quite different and tipping is the norm).On the first day| we were having a drink at about 6 p.m. at the Deck next to the pool| and asked the bar staff to book us a table at La Caravelle for dinner that night. They assured us that it was done| yet when we showed up later| the reservation was not there (we were seated nevertheless but my point is the reservation should have been there).Another day| we called the restaurant reservation desk and booked at Il Corallo for that night. Again| we showed up and the maitre d' could not find our reservation. Twice in four days!On our final day| I left my wife at the Deck for lunch| and rushed back to the room to get some money out of our safe. I found a note that the safe had been left open and that I had to call reception for the code. It was my mistake to leave it open| I understand| but I called reception and asked to have the code sent over immediately as my wife was waiting for lunch. I waited 10-15 minutes. Nothing. I called again| and she asked| ""Oh| he isn't there yet?"" and promised to send someone else. It took another 7-8 minutes from there. By the time I reached the restaurant| my food was completely cold (to the staff's credit| they did give me fresh food and a drink| which I appreciate).Finally| Rachel (Guest relations) called me the morning we were checking out and promised to meet us before we leave due to the issues in the restaurant the previous day. We checked out as promised at 12 o'clock| but no Rachel. By this time| sadly| it is what we had come to expect.HousekeepingWe came back to the room one day and found a dirty napkin on the bedside table (after housekeeping had visited). Another day| we found a dirty spoon next to the coffeemaker. The third day| the dirty spoon was gone| but a clean spoon had not taken its place. These are important touches that indicate the level of care taken by housekeeping.Please understand that you are positioning yourselves as a ""5+ star"" resort| and are charging 5-star prices. If you do not provide the service associated with that| why should anyone come back? For the record| I have stayed at luxury resorts around the world from Jamaica to India to Thailand to Indonesia| and never have I experienced such poor service.I trust you will take my feedback seriously and work to correct the deficiencies. Please let me know if you need any further information from me.Best regards|Nakul Pasricha",New Delhi| India,20-08-13,No,3
Great location beside the beach| well thought out rooms,This resort is well designed with rooms set out like Villas| so that even though there are four in a block the angle of the room against your neighbours gives excellent privacy and peace and quiet.Within each block of villas | which are all thatched and set amongst lush gardens is a separate pool and seating area| separate to the main oasis pool area.This means there is plenty of choice with regard to pools. there is also direct access onto the beach| which is a long thin sandy beach with plenty of sun loungers and thatched umbrellas.Whilst on the beach you do have to put up with occasional traders approaching you but overall they are fairly easy going once you say no.The rooms| even the basic junior suites are well equipped and spacious with large rainforest showers and a super double sized deep bath| two sinks and separate toilet. the bedrooms are also large with outdoor balconies| ours overlooked the smaller central pool ( not the main pool).There are several restaurants on site which overall are quite expensive if you are not on full or half board|but they do provide a wide variety of foods. The breakfasts are amazing and provide all sorts of delights from healthy through to very naughty waffles| pastries| pancakes etc!!The gym instructors at this place are very motivated and better than average. I did aqua aerobics every day with a different instructor for each class for 7 days it was very enjoyable. I also used the gym every day | taking circuit training and spin classes| what I noticed is that they take you through warm up and stretching very thoroughly| they are also quite hard core instructors| so if you want a boot camp in the sun| this is good for exercise.Overall a great location and great rooms| very child orientated| so great for families.,Leeds| United Kingdom,20-08-13,No,4
We really loved our renewal of vows,We were at this hotel for 9 night| from the end of July to the beginning of August. There we did a renewal of vows for our 25th wedding anniversary. The hotel is amazing and very romantic. The tropical gardens are very beautiful| very green and very well tended. Our Villa (Tropical Junior Suit Plus) was spacious and we specially loved our private outdoor shower. The 7 different pools are very peaceful and pleasant. Don't miss out on the Mauritian cuisine buffet at the L'Oasis restaurant| it's heavenly! Book a table and dine at the Indian cuisine restaurant| it's a must. Don't miss the daily lunch menu at the Le Deck restaurant. The hotel staff is very friendly and always available to take care of your every need. The spa service is excellent. We'd like to give special thanks to Teelasha and Fatima| always smiling and ready to help. Teelasha was extremely efficient in the preparation and during our renewal of vows ceremony| which was held at the beach. The flower arch was excellent and everything went great. Everyone should go there for their renewal of vows. We really really really loved it! We only wish they had more night entertainment.,Porto| Portugal,19-08-13,No,5
Most amazing place!,My partner and I had our civil ceremony in the UK and then went here for our honeymoon. When we arrived in the afternoon we were greeted warmly with drinks| hot towels and friendliness! We were instantly upgraded to full board| we had champagne and fresh fruit waiting for us in our room| free gift certificates and a massage voucher for the (amazing) Clarins spa!Our representative was the loveliest person and nothing was too much for them. We were a little worried about how they would be about a gay couple staying however they were lovely. The food was absolutely fantastic with 6 restaurants on site all serving different meals. We actually couldn't decide where to eat most nights!The staff and service was faultless and the resort was gorgeous. It was kept up to scratch every day and the beach was lovely. The nightlife was excellent and the drinks reasonably priced. We really cannot find any faults AT ALL with this resort and would recommend it to everyone thinking of going to Mauritius!,Brighton| England| United Kingdom,05-08-13,No,5
Beautiful hotel| superb rooms| fantastic snorkelling| wonderful staff,Just returned from a wonderful two week holiday. Family of four| our children are 6 and 8| and we stayed in one of the family suites - I was incredibly impressed with the rooms. Very spacious with separate kids bedroom and their own shower| adults had bath| indoor and outdoor shower.The hotel is large| so offers a wide variety of restaurants and food| with excellent sports activities. However| the arrangement of the rooms| based in low rise groups each around their own quite reasonable pool| meant that it very feels intimate and never institutional. The gardens are very mature| with a wide variety of large trees| which made even the walk back to the rooms in the evening enjoyable.The children really enjoyed the buffet breakfast| and dinner. There was a great variety of food| with good fresh fruit. We ate in the other restaurants| although that was more enjoyed by the adults than the youngest child (but they made a great effort| producing a simple| special meal for the 6 year old on the family night at the Thai restaurant). The special for lunch changed each day on the beach front restaurant| and offered a great mix of curry| fish and pasta dishes. Often there would be live music| and some nights entertainment after dinner on the beach. I was looking forward to the food| and wasn't disappointed.We chose the full-board pus option| and I think this was a good choice - the meals would have quickly added up| as the menu prices were quite high. One slight niggle was that the number of menu choices with a supplement was quite high| and the supplement was pretty much the full price.Another great part of the holiday was the sport. We played tennis most days on high quality courts. The water sport options were particularly good| and included in the price. My son (9) and I both tried water skiing| the staff were very good - and I was surprised we both ended with their advice successfully skiing on the rope. Snorkelling trips out beyond the reef were 3 times a day (you could see fish off the beach| but really you needed to take the short boat ride). There was a fantastic variety of fish. The snorkelling compared well with other places we've been; for example Perhentian Islands in Malaysia. There were no sharks or turtles| but we did see and manage to swim with a pod of dolphins as they were feeding in the area.There is not much outside the hotel| but there are many buses to Port Louis and much cheaper (88 rupee each way for 4) than the hotel taxis (1500 rupee for the day). The botanical gardens are also nearby| and worth a visit (we did take a taxi here| although there were bus options).The staff were fantastic| welcoming at dinner. Even the room cleaning was early well done (the children loved the careful arrangement of their cuddly toys on the bed). The beach is public and there is some hawking| but not particularly aggressive. And I have to say that the boat trip to the dolphins I put off until the end from one of the companies on the beach| but in the end it was a real highlight. I wasn't expecting one of the drivers to don snorkel and flipper jump in the water with me and help point out the dolphins. (After nearly an hour I had to admit defeat| I just couldn't swim as fast as either the dolphins or him. But we had both enjoyed ourselves.) Trip was 4000 rupee for all family| quite a long speedboat ride as the dolphins were around the corner of the bay| and then 1 hour watching a swimming.I don't think we could have done better.,Cambridge| United Kingdom,03-08-13,No,5
Lovely Location and breathtaking scenery,We have just returned from a 11 night stay and had an incredible time! I wouldn't label Mauritius as a honeymoon destination| let alone the resort| as there are quite a significant amount of families around which is not my idea of a honeymoon. The beach and clarity of the water were out of this world!! I miss that already! I would definitely go back with children. My thoughts on the resort:1. The service is a hit and miss - in my opinion it is not consistent with a 5 star hotel such as Starwood and Jumeirah hotels/resorts. At first you they are wonderful| with guest relations attending to you for the first two days and then their attitude completely changes. The resort lacked a decent conceierge service| which is a requirement of a 5 star hotel! We were very lucky we did our own research!!2. The location is quite isolated| grand baie is close by which is worth going to for dinner and during the day for a change of scenery. If you enjoy staying in one location then this is great for you.3. The landscaping is exceptional and the beach is spectacular. One of the best beaches on the island! We never wanted to leave! The rooms are very spread out which offers great privacy. The rooms are lovely| especially the bathroom. I definitely miss the rain shower! 4. The water activities are provided for free are great! I would really recommend using the paddle boats to just float around the water. As it is a lagoon the water is quite still - no waves (go to the south if you want to surf). The stretch of beach is exceptionally long so you will always get a stretcher. Snorkeling here is much better than going to flat island which is north of grand baie! We are extremely lucky we avoided the south coast as the beach is quite messy and appears dirty/murky! 5. Food was overall Poor - this is the only other major downside apart from service. As an Italian coming from Dubai| that offers incredible food in terms of taste| texture and price regardless if you eat at a mall or in a 5 star resort| this hotel lacked any of that. The thai was one of the better restaurants. I would avoid the Italian restaurant - it is not Italian food whatsoever| I question if they cook their tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes or just use it straight from a tin. The price for any menu item is extremely pricey! If you plan on staying for breakfast| lunch and dinner go for full board plus| but there are supplements for most of the dishes. Overall my boyfriend and I had an incredible holiday - the beach definitely made up for the poor quality of food and service.,Dubai| Dubai| United Arab Emirates,03-08-13,No,4
Great trip,The resort is amazing! So beautiful and well maintained. We were on a family holiday with our 2 year old daughter| she loved every minute of swimming| playing on the beach and the mini club. The hotel staff are very accommodating and always asking if everything is ok and if we were happy and enjoying our stay. I highly recommend this resort! 5 stars !,Chester| England,31-07-13,No,5
This place is awesome,Whatever accommodation you have it great. If you have kids| this is the place for you. The kids club is great and you can even hire a Child minder.The various restaurants offer good food.The beach and surround is second to none.The pool is fantastic for all agesThe best part is the Staff| I have been to lots of places over the world and it would be hard to beat the attentiveness and courteousness of the staffOnly downside| which has nothing to do with Hotel| is the transfer to and from airport| in that you have to go through the capital Port Louis| which is a nightmare. I believe they are doing a bypass that may be ready in a couple of yearsHighly recommended,Chester| England,30-07-13,No,5
Beautiful resort| perfect family holiday!,We have just returned from a 10 night stay and had the most wonderful family holiday (our children are aged 4 & 2). I'm writing this review as we did a LOT of research before we went (including reviews on here!) - it does go on a bit......(apologies!)The resort is beautiful - lush tropical gardens with colourful flowers that back right into a gorgeous beach and the most amazing blue sea I have ever seen. The beach is raked every morning| the sand is fine & the kids loved playing in it. It does have a little coral as you enter the water but the kids wore beach shoes or were careful and the hawkers were not a problem at all. There were lots of loungers and the water sports were fantastic (the staff operating it were very helpful & friendly). We stayed this side of the island because of going in July - and the temperature during the day was a very lovely 21 degrees (which actually felt more like 24). The only down side was that the large pool (which is stunning) was a little brisk at times because the sun wasn't strong enough to warm it. However the kids enjoyed playing in the shallower parts (which were perfect for them) for short periods and we did brave it a few times. The resort do recognise this though and as there are individual pools by the accommodation| the pool right by ours was heated and a great temperature - so we swapped between the 2!We stayed in a Tropical Suite Plus room and specifically asked for one not too close to the main area| but not too far away either. I think we were in 338 (downstairs) and it was actually the perfect location. We could easily walk to the restaurants etc (but could still get a ride in the golf buggy back which the kids loved). We could very very faintly hear the music at night but were so tired it didn't bother us at all. The room was a great size for a family of 4. My boys both shared the single bed (top & tailed). Our bed was huge so when one of them crawled in| in the early hours there was still room for us all to get a few extra hours sleep. We still had plenty of room to move around. The outdoor shower is fantastic (we've stayed a few places with them and this was the best) and everything was very clean. The blackout curtains were a bonus and appreciated! Nice outdoor area & furniture opening up to the lovely gardens (and the pool). The beach front rooms looked lovely when we walked past but the pools were always in the shade (not sure if they were heated) and not that private. Literally 20 steps from our room you could see the beach anyway and the tropical garden view was gorgeous (if money is no object go for it| but we were very happy with our room). The facilities are great. Breakfast was a great hit (lots of choose from & delicious) - we preferred the more intimate La Caravelle and then switched between there & The Deck for lunch (they have slightly different lunch menus). The evening buffet was fantastic - the food every night was way above our expectations and there was always something for everyone and so much to choose from. The serving staff in both were very attentive & efficient| however we would like to give a special mention to Menon in La Caravelle who went above & beyond & made sure everything was perfect for us. We of course tested out the Indian (great atmosphere & staff - but as great lovers of Indian food we found it a bit bland & would have loved more spice & flavour| although it was one of the best Indian desserts I've ever had)| the Thai (better food| still good but still not amazing - we preferred the buffet! However Raj also deserves a special mention!) and the Italian for our 10th Wedding Anniversary (fantastic food| a table on its own & a surprise chocolate cake). I used the spa twice for treatments (my husband once). It's a must on your stay! The steam room has LED lights in the ceiling that change colour| the decor and surrounds are beautiful and the staff very professional. One of the best massages I've ever had. Our little boy at 2.5 was too young to go into the kids club but we took them for an hour one day for a play and stayed with them. We went on holiday to spend time with our children so aren't big fans of kids clubs| but it was big & very well planned out. We did use the babysitting service a few times and the sitter looked after them in the kids club in the evenings so they could play with everything there & they were very happy!The hotel staff right the way through were great (friendly & professional| even the gardeners would say Hello & Good morning) and when we arrived| it was without our luggage due to a delayed connecting flight. The hotel gave us both t-shirts and 2 lots for the children as well as emergency kits containing toothbrushes| combs etc. They also chased it up & kept us informed and told us to contact them if they could help in any other way. The boutique there is lovely but expensive! (So we nipped into St Louis to get some basics for our first day & luckily it turned up the next evening). We went half board so brekkie & dinner were included (even in the other onsite restaurants). We weighed up the cost of full board plus when we got there (you can upgrade when there at any time) and for us it just wasn't worth it. We bought 2 lunches each day (they were a great size) and they give you a basket of bread| so there was plenty to share between us and 2 young kids. Prices were pretty much the same as a lunch out in Melbourne - as were the beer & wine prices. Even with a beer at lunch and a few glasses of wine in the evening we were well under what we would have paid for the full board plus and wouldn't have got much more. The wine is South African & very nice (especially the Rose!). A little tip - don't order a taxi through the hotel - they're so expensive. Just step outside the hotel & the hotel taxis will offer you a ride there & you can negotiate your price with them. If they don't there was always a taxi passing which we got much cheaper than the hotel quoted us. The little shops a few mins walk up the road are great to get beer/snacks too. I'd definitely recommend Trou Aux Biches :-),Melbourne| Australia,29-07-13,No,5
Holiday of a Lifetime !,We stayed here for 13 nights. A family of 4| with 2 kids and 3 vegetarians. It was simply an amazing experience and after coming back home to India| we still talk about Trou Aux Biches resort. We have stayed at resorts all over the world and generally have maintained that the service provided by high end resorts in India is generally not available when we travel to other countries| which have higher labour costs and a bigger self help culture. But Trou Aux Biches Resort - we experienced a level of service we had never seen before. The property is great| the beach is the best in Mauritius I think| the apartments and villas are super| the kids club is good| all 6 restaurants are super| but what makes this place special is the people who work here. No request ever seemed too much. They were always so conscious that our group was a bit of an odd one and might feel well tended to. First we had Kids| then both Kids were Vegetarians| one of the adults was vegetarian; we are Indian and often find non Indian vegetarian food lacking in variety and taste. Second| this resort is mainly visited by Europeans| Americans and couples. So you can understand that both cuisine wise as well demographically| we were probably not the standard customer profile for the resort. The effort that all the staff made in every meal and overall in our stay to make us comfortable and feel at home told us that they take every guest very seriously and are truly concerned..it was touching actually. At times we would have 3 different type of meals served on our table| kiddy veg| adult veg and adult non veg. I bet both the kiddy veg and the adult veg was made just for us. In a resort that houses 700 people - this was special. They have some amazing people like Jay from the Buffet - he was one the best and went out of the way every single time to make us comfortable. Devi and Randhir from the buffet were also very special| as was Leckraj from the Indian Kitchen. Chef Lorenzo from the Italian Kitchen and the Chef from the Indian Kitchen were all absolutely superb people and went out of their way. Overall| I can’t recommend Trou Aux Biches resort enough. Its was simply a holiday of a Lifetime for us. Thank you every one at the resort.,New Delhi,28-07-13,No,5
A Tropical Paradise on Earth!,We just got back from an amazing Honeymoon at Trou! There is very little you can fault about this resort| the location is perfect| on the right side of the island for the weather with a relatively quiet and secluded beach. The facilities are amazing with very attentive and professional staff throughout. There is a wide choice of food in the many restaurants so going full board does not result in monotony. We would go back here in a second!,London| United Kingdom,27-07-13,No,5
Excellent,Beautiful white sands| Great hospitality| kids club is good| Fatima is a wonderful person | she makes sure that all the services are in Excellent . Great experiance| a must visit place. Travelled with twins and an elder child.,Noida| India,22-07-13,No,5
Vacation in Paradise,What can I say| and where shall I begin.We booked our vacation with Diane Hamilton @ Chaka Travel. She has provided a 5* service throughout our booking| and also the advise she provided was always honest which we benefitted from. Especially when she advised us to stay here| and on the North part of the Island the weather is much nicer| and she wasn't wrong.My husband and i just returned from Mauritius on the 14th July| We were pretty skeptical regarding the weather reviews| however upon arrival till we departed we saw no rain and only sunshine. The weather was typically that of a beautiful summers day. On Friday 5th July we began our holiday| WOW was my immediate reaction when we arrived on Saturday in Mauritius| and as I walked into the Tru Aux Biches resort I felt I had arrived in Paradise. It was a stunning sight| the weather was simply perfect. We watched the most beautiful sunset that evening| then had a meal at the Thai restaurant to celebrate our Anniversary| we were welcomed so well and the staff sang to us and provided us with a beautiful cake| after which we then went to the bar to enjoy the band. I was lucky enough to have found out last minute that my very good friend has a friend in Mauritius who owns there own Excursion company| so I ended up booking with her the Lions Interaction| BBQ on Benetian Island via speed boat| Snorkelling| swimming with dolphins| Casela park Safari| Shiva temple| Chamarel| and the seven coloured earth tour – these sites were all magnificent. (http://www.kreola.mu/contact.html) we didnt pre-book any excursions as i found they were so expensive| however there rates were superb and we managed to do all the excursions we wanted within our budget) We enjoyed Tru Aux Biches own water sports also which were included in the price so we could use the paddle boats| snorkelling as much as we wanted for free| as well as dining at each of there fabulous restaurants. Our time each day there was so valued and special| it really was a very special 7 days| that when I sadly had to leave I felt I was leaving a family behind as the staff were all so welcoming. I was still left mesmerised by Mauritius beauty and culture.At lunch time we used to eat at the restaurant by the bar| and my husband always requested a healthy option of food| and me being vegeterian they created dishes for us which weren't even on the menu which was a added touch. It really was a breath taking moment of our lives. The experience we had was one we will treasure for a lifetime| and I can only thank Diane & Trou Aux Biches for all your superb efforts| If you are a tennis fan| take your own tennis balls and you can borrow the tennis rackets| fantastic courts| and gym.Definately try the Trou Aux Biches body massage| it was beautiful| and they leave this oil in your hair which was great for conditioning after being in the sun all day. Defiantely a resort for family with children| couples| friends| or if you just want a time out on a beautiful isand. Its very safe| and the people are just wonderful.,London,22-07-13,No,5
Amazing wedding proposal and holiday!!!,I had planned 6 weeks in advance to take my girlfriend to this amazing hotel and propose in a romantic setting. The views are out of this world| magical even! The whole hotel staff was in the loop regarding the proposal| they looked after us well and the Chef delivered the ring to the table with champagne after a romantic beach dinner :)) - my girl friend was speechless!!Everything was spot on throughout the whole weekend and the most important dinner I've ever had couldn't have gone any better. We had a magical weekend| the food| welcome and scenery is amazing - I even left the engagement ring with the hotel team to surprise my girlfriend so she receives it as desert... everyone really went the extra mile to make this a night and a weekend to remember :D ..and most importantly the lady said yes hahaha| we'll definitely be back.. fully recommended for any holiday but specially for couples looking for a romantic escapade!! Thank you for the experience!!,Mauritius,16-07-13,No,5
Nice hotel,Stayed here for a week and a half. It was quite good. Reason I can't say it is amazing| amazing| amazing| is because I think the place is not quite such good value for money. The food and drink in the hotel is expensive| disproportionately so to other hotels| bars| cafes etc. Rooms are brilliant and the bathrooms are amazing. Also the hotel has some bikes to use| but you can only use them on the hotel grounds| which is ridiculous and a little pointless having them. Also the taxis will rip you off as soon as they realise you want them to take you back to this hotel| as it is probably the most expensive in Trou aux Biches. The taxis the hotels organise are over-priced| just walk out on to the road and get your own| don't book their taxis. I would definitely recommend going to the Sugar Museum (not for the museum) but for the restaurant that is attached to it and the shop. Bizarrely| the restaurant by the side of the musem is one of the best ones we ate at the whole time in Mauritius. You must have a dessert there. The shop there also has some good things to buy. The hotel is a little out the way| and is a 10-12 minutes taxi ride to Grand Baie - which is quite good to go to for food (although you'll need to know which restaurant you want to go to| as they are quite spaced out and you can't walk between them easily).Staff were all very attentive and polite. The water sports stuff was ok too| but they were incredibly over the top with safety....they made me put a life jacket on to go wide surfing in about two metres of water. The Thai restaurant in the hotel is very expensive - save your money and go to Sakura in Grand Baie - it is amazing - reserve a table where they cook the food for you - it is brilliant.If I was to return to Mauritius I would be unlikely to return to this hotel| but wouldn't necessarily suggest others not to stay here. Main reason for not returning is| because you could be anywhere in the world| sat in some fancy(ish) hotel on the beach. It doesn't give you that Mauritian 'feeling' and is too far away from anything to mean you can experience Mauritius properly. If you want to pay quite a lot of money to feel like you are sat anywhere in the world on a beach| then stay here....if you don't then don't.,London| United Kingdom,12-07-13,No,4
Excellent vacations!!! I was in Paradise!!!,I visited Mauritius with my mother for first time and choosed to stay in Trou Aux Biches from 22/6 to 2/7 2013. From the very first minute I steped my foot in this Hotel I realised that I had made the best choise!!!! It is like Paradise on earth!!! Although the weather was not very good (was cold and did not have the proper cloths with me)| In this hotel I forgot about it!!! It is situated in a huge garden full of palm tress and other beautifull plants. Outside the hotel in walking distance there is the village with very good shops for shopping!!! Could'nt stop walking among the Palm trees| looking at the ocean| dreamming while watching the sunset!!! My room was a big family suite with external shower| behind the Il Corallo restaurant. It was beautiful| very big| and felt like I was at my home!!! The hotel stuff is excellent and I made many friends!!! I want to thank everyone| and especially Fatima| for making me feel wonderfull and treated me like I was a queen!!! Also many thanks to the restaurants| because they took care of me and my allergies! The food was delicious!!! I also visited the SPA | which is very beautiful| and had some great treatments that really helped my body!!! I highly recomend Trou Aux Biches to everyone who wants to have the perfect vacation in Mauritius!!!,Agrinio| Greece,07-07-13,No,5
An experience| not just a hotel!,We spent 9 spectacular days at this very special five star resort and spa. This was a holiday that surpassed all expectations. The exquisite beach| beautiful crystal clear water| amazing sea life| with winter weather that allowed us to be in the sun and sea every day| will be a first choice for another beach holiday. There were pedal boats| kayaks| sailing boats| glass bottomed boats all on tap| any time we wished to use them| with friendly and knowledgable nautical staff to assist around the clock. We water skied every day too| and snorkelled with colourful fish. We even swam with dolphins| what a treat! The staff were always ready with a smile and nothing was ever too much trouble. Fatima and Sophie were always there to ensure that all was well. The suites were spacious and luxurious| and the food was delicious| 6 restaurants to choose from and a buffet breakfast every morning. The hotel is beautiful and the layout unique! We left with heavy hearts| but we are all counting the days till our return. We will not sample another hotel in Mauritius after this!

A great Hotel even in winter,"I'm back form a family holidays in Trou Aux Biches hotel in Mauritius.It's a great Hotel. The rooms are fantastic 5* Suits. great level of comfort. The hotel restaurants are great| all the a-la-carte as well as the buffet one. the personnel shows dedication and really want to help.A special mention for the nautical activities. there are some kayak| windsurf and hobbie-cat ready to be used and the boat-house team are ready to put the boat in the water| three times a day they have a boat ready to go snorkelling at the ref barrier plus a glass bottom boat. On top of it they provided Water-sky at no extra cost| and they boat drivers/instructors are really kind with everybody| those learning as well as those who already know how to do it. Summarizing| even in Mauritius winter when weather is a little bit un-predictable| the hotel is still a paradise.I did not use the SPA services but it looks great... like the rest of the Hotel.The customer relationship Manager Fatima was there on every dinner and lunch| she knew who we were by our names and kept asking the most popular question at the Hotel ""Are you happy?"" and the answer was clearly ""YES"".I would also recommend it for Honeymooners and families.",Barcelona| Spain,03-07-13,No,5
Unbelievably amazing and luxurious,We've been to Le Victoria and we have been to Trou Aux Biches -- so have compared two different hotels (just 15 minutes drive apart). I have to say that Trou Aux Biches is a massive cut above Le Victoria in both facilities| rooms and the beach. The beach has clear turquoise water and is not rocky| and the rooms are modern and upmarket (with outside showers too). The restaurants (six of them) are beautiful and the food is excellent. This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in| and is more of an intimate stay than compared with Le Victoria. We will be back and cannot recommend this hotel more highly. The staff and manager were absolutely awesome... alert| friendly -- we were treated like kings. The manageress popped around constantly to see how we were doing. She is an asset to the hotel| and it made our stay that much better. Thank you for a PERFECT stay.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,30-06-13,No,5
A memorable experience,A luxurious holiday which had a very fine mix of upwardly mobile hospitality| great food and beverage experiences| world class water sports facilities| well kept and modern rooms and an extremely serene ocean front setting. Would love to be there again. ,Delhi,30-06-13,No,5
Awesome hotel,We stayed here in June and had a great time. The staff are extremely nice and make you feel like a guest in their home. The hotel itself is beautifully built| sitting on a white sandy beach with turquoise blue waters. There is plenty to do as well| from the watersports centre| gym area| tennis courts and spa. The weather was great when we went. If you needed something done| Fatima (the hotel's manageress) and her team were able to sort it out and help you. We have a young 8 month baby and the staff were accomadating in providing him with food as required. The restaurant staff and very accomandating for my wife who is vegetarian. We really enjoyed our holiday and would love to come back again,London| United Kingdom,22-06-13,No,5
Amazing Hotel| amazing staff especially Magalie at the front desk!!,We stayed here from the 16th of June 2013 for 5 nights and nothing was too much bother or worry for the staff. They have obviously had extensive customer training as their services are trully exceptional. Major 5 star to the fantastic Magalie at reception who is just a fab person.The food in the hotel is quite expensive which we did not realise until day 3 where we discovered restaurants down the road on the right of the hotel. We kept taking the left and all the restaurants were closed!The food is delicious and food that cost us 4|270 rupees a night (just dinner) at the hotel we found| was a rip off (cant blame them though| what you pay at a 5 star hotel) as a meal cost between 90 - 110 rupees at the restaurants.We were very disappointed but atleast we were able to save some money before we spent all our money on food at the hotel. Do not take a taxi into Grand bay which is another rip off(500 rupees for a single journey)...take the bus which cost 28 rupees per person. Or better still| you can walk down the beach from Trou aux biches to Grand bay.However| this was one of the best holidays so far with so much sight seeing to do| water sports| dolphin watching! Oh| by the way| do not pay crazy amounts of money to go on a Catamaran cruise as just a few minutes (3) by speed boat from the hotel beach| you can see the dolphins who actually run at the sound of the boat engines. It's quite hard to even get a picture of them but such a beautiful site to behold!I will definately stay at Trou aux biches if i visit Mauritius again. A truly beautiful resort!,London| United Kingdom,22-06-13,No,5
Simply the best,"Me and my husband stayed at the legendary Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa from the first of June 2013| for a week. Since we were old regulars| having visited this hotel more than 15 times since 1991| we were a bit apprehensive| this time being our first visit since the re-opening of the ""new"" Trou aux Biches resort. We need not have worried. As soon as we got out of our car the wonderful (and just as legendary) manageress Fatima Chuttoo embraced us warmly and made us feel instantly at home. The resort is nothing like the old one but the improvements are spectacular. A lot of thought has gone into every aspect of this breathtakingly beautiful hotel and it truly is like walking into paradise. I can not praise the various food in the six restaurants enough and unfortunately my waistline is proof of that. But my highest accolades go to Fatima and her team| quite a number of whom we knew from before. I have never experienced a more well run hotel with the staff making us feel so welcome and engaged at every turn. Thank you Fatima| you and your wonderful team made us fall in love with Trou aux Biches all over again and we can't wait to come back.",Johannesburg| South Africa,20-06-13,No,5
Nothing is impossible in Paradise!,From the moment you step into the incredible reception area| you know you have arrived at a very special place. New guests are memorised (as we were) by the sheer beauty and elegance of the hotel and the staff greeting you| making so very welcome from the minute you arrive| until the second you leave. The hotel and grounds are immaculate with staff pruning| brushing| chopping and cleaning constantly. In 2008 the resort closed (for 2 years) whilst it was completely renovated and it is now truly stunning. We took a 'very' long time to research the resorts in Mauritius| as this was our honeymoon. Locals have since advised us that this resort is renowned to be the one of the best on the island and 'the North' has the best beaches with Trou aux Biche having the best!Without exception the food is sumptuous (don't miss cookery demonstrations)| and several times a week there are buffets| which are magnificent. Drinks are not included in any board options (other than breakfast) - and its worth noting you will pay London prices for your drinks too. Mauritius is generally expensive as so much is imported. This is the perfect couples romantic retreat| the beach a few steps from the vast infinity pools| all beaches are public but the only locals you'll see are 'looky looky' men| who will leave you alone (if you don't ask a question - any question) or grab a bargain as we did  (they are actually incredibly friendly and hardworking| as are most Mauritians!). Copious amounts of water sports and lazing on the beach really did sum up most days (we did aqua-gym not to be confused with aqua aerobics or the word 'easy'!) however| there are plenty of excursions if you want to leave the resort - we couldn't tear ourselves away! The rooms are beautiful (what did we expect?)| the beds comfortable (and huge!) and the gorgeous outdoor shower was a hit with my husband (we stayed in a tropical suite). Take a hairdryer as typically the hairdryer isn't too effective! No need for adapters either - three pin plugs and same voltage.Evening entertainment was totally perfect for this romantic resort where fabulous singers serenaded you beautifully until the last person leaves the bar (don't expect Ibiza anthems here).  But what truly set this resort apart| other than all of the above| is Fatima (The manager extraordinaire) and her wonderful team. We were made to feel so special - nothing| literally  was impossible! From the speed of service| to the quality of the smiles and the sheer determination of the team to ensure our time there was perfect| the service was incredible and we are eternally grateful to Fatima and her team for making our honeymoon the most memorable we could have imagined. We want to say special thanks to Dave| Hans| Laval| Anwar and Jay (look out for them and say hi from us!) who were so kind| helpful and so generous with their time constantly - they always said 'nothing is impossible here' and it truly wasn't!,Cobham| United Kingdom,20-06-13,No,5
A truly beautiful resort,I had the pleasure of staying there whilst on business and the service is first class. The staff are most friendly and helpful with many having worked there for a number of years. It is quite obvious that the staff have had excellent training. The resort is beautifully kept with lovely gardens and swimming pools and of course situated on the beach. Yes| its expensive but thats Mauritius for you. We stayed in a villa with its own pool and it was first class. The 3 bedroom villa had 2 bathrooms| one of which was fit for a King/Queen. We enjoyed the Indian and Thai restaurants in the resorts but found the Buffets to be very ordinary for the price - very little seafood either! Not sure about the security as non-residents can easily access the hotel from the beach.,billericay| uk,17-06-13,No,5
Truly Amazing Hotel,Spent 3 weeks in May at this truly fabulous hotel. From the moment we arrived shattered we were greeted by the wonderful Teelasha who could not of made us feel more welcome. Teelasha was also our wedding coordinator and gave us the wonderful news of our free up grade to a beach front suite with our own pool courtesy of the hotel. This hotel is set in stunning surroundings and has been designed to a very high standard and gives a fabulous romantic feel. The grounds are covered with beautiful flowers| the pool areas are fabulous especially the ones at the back of our room (657) it was like having our own private pool as most guests seem to enjoy the main large pool or the beach. We ate in all 6 of the restaurants which all served food to a high standard| my favourite was the Caravelle. Staff in the hotel were extremely friendly| nothing was too much trouble. We got married on 6th May under the banyan tree which really is a stunning location at the resort. I had my hair and makeup done by Deborah from the Spa and she did a fantastic job| and also came back to my room to help me in my dress| and any last minute makeup touches required. We then had a fabulous meal in the Caravelle with our family and friends| the manager Jerome gave us a private area in the restaurant and we had 2 members of staff that served us all night which I must say we're so attentive. The Spa area is pribably one of ghe best i have ever seen| we also had some treatments which again were relaxing and of a high standard. This really is a fabulous hotel of exceptional high standard and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone wanting a piece of luxury in paradise. Huge thanks to Fatima| Teelasha| Jerome| Veeshal & Revandra| Manish| Deborah| Kevin among many more that helped create our perfect holiday and wedding.,Paris| France,16-06-13,No,5
More a holiday club than a 5* - Huge hotel suitable for groups,We booked 5 nights at the Trou aux Biches after spending 5 marvelous nights at the St Regis Mauritius (see my other review). Check-in was smooth and easy and we were offered complimentary full board instead of half board| which was a nice gesture.The hotel is huge and you need to walk around with a map. The set up is quite nice as newly renovated but the hotel has no identity or personality.We got to our room and instantly we realized that it was very dark. There was another block of rooms in front of us| hence no view and no natural light! Coming from the St Regis where we had a beautiful sea view| this was impossible to take. Also| everything in the room looked cheap: towels| bathrobe| bath products| slippers| furniture...It really felt like we were driving a Ferrari for 5 days and it has now been replaced with a Fiat (no offence to Fiat)! The downgrade was too steep! We went to the reception to ask for a room change. We thought this should not be a problem since the hotel was around 20% full (which is already a lot of people). They told us they had no Beachfront room available. We then asked them to cancel our stay as we cannot accept to stay in the room they gave us. They were a bit stunned and said that they will check again. A couple of minutes later| they miraculously found a beachfront room and suggested we move there the next day as it was a bit late. Also| we would have to pay 50% extra for the room! This was actually more expensive than the St Regis room we had which was stunning and the St Regis hotel as a whole was far far far nicer. These hotels are definitely not in the same category.We told them that we wish to cancel and go back to the St Regis. We paid one night as it was too late to cross the whole island. We phoned the St Regis to ask them if they would have us back. They were delighted and even proposed to send a car to pick us up. In order to avoid the humiliation to the Trou aux Biches hotel of having a St Regis Jaguar pick us up after we cancelled our stay| we decided to go back by our own means the next morning. No one from management cared to come and see us to know why we cancelled our stay 40 minutes after arrival! This would have been the least you would expect for a Mauritian 5* hotel. We then went to dinner. It was a buffet and again the difference in the quality of food compared to the St Regis was huge. We had the impression of eating in a canteen| and we went to the smaller restaurant and not the main one. We do not dare to imagine how it must be when the hotel is full. We felt more that this hotel was a holiday village rather than a 5*. Anyway| they seem to care much more about groups rather than individual clients. One good example of the level of this hotel is the breakfast: paper towels| no freshly squeezed juice| low quality pastries ( likely frozen)| etc... Cost cutting?We could not wait to go away to a true 5* hotel. This hotel forms part of the Beachcomber group which normally offers a better service than this. Maybe they see the Trou aux Biches as only a hotel for groups. It seemed to be the case as they really did not care about individual clients. I have left my name and address on their customer satisfaction card and told them I was surprised by the lack of care of management. I doubt I will have a response. I also doubt that they will reply to this comment on Tripadvisor which would be proof that they do not care about individual clients. I am Mauritian and and have always recommended my friends| colleagues and clients to take Beachcomber hotels as it is a mauritian group - I will definitely stop doing so. That the Trou aux Biches hotel is a 5* is a shame for the Mauritian hotel industry.,Paris| France,16-06-13,No,2
Best stay of our lives (Special thank you to Fatima and Jerome),We just came back from the most amazing week of our lives. We spent one week at Trou aux Biches Resort and spa ( our second stay in six months ) and got married there with few of our family and friends. All of us had an amazing time !!Not only the resort benefits from an amazing setting but is also wonderfully managed by very competent and professional people- The beach is just stunning (ranked most beautiful beach in the world few years ago i believe )- The hotel is by far the most luxurious one we have ever stayed at. We are lucky enough to have stayed at numerous 5 stars resorts in Mauritius and across the world and TAB is definitely number one by all aspects- The rooms are very clean and really well kept and really luxurious| we stayed in a senior pool villa| if you can go for it| it s definitely worth it. Saying that we had the occasion to see the other category of room and they are all absolutely fabulous- the food is just unbelievable way above a 5 star resort food but more comparable to 2 or 3 michelin star restaurant in europe and we do have extensive knowledge of these..... This is especially due to very skilled and passionate chefs. Thank you again to Chef Paul and his staff for all his work through the week and for our wedding day the food was just unbelievable.Now we established Trou aux Biches Resort is the best hotel we have ever stayed at| We need to insist that the real strength and gem of the hotel is the passionate| professional| dedicated| very honest| helpful and friendly staff. Our stay wouldn't have been that amazing if it hadn't been for all the hard work provided by everyone and especially Fatima the manager and Jerome the F&B Manager . Thank you so much to both of them and everyone working with them (Sophie| Allan| Sandro| Chef Paul| and everyone else we are not mentioning...). Fatima and Jerome definitely made us feel they were going out of their way to make our week what it was : an unforgettable memory and the best week of our lives !! They spent so much time and effort during the week but also before our arrival to make sure that everything would be perfect for us and our small group! and it was beyond perfect thanks to them !!!We would highly recommend to stay at TAB for anyone looking for an amazing holidays! We are already planning our third stay there !!,London| United Kingdom,10-06-13,No,5
Simply the Best,We stayed at the fabulous Trou Aux Biches hotel in Mauritius. Thanks to the world class service and style we were treated like royalty. The manager Fatima Chuttoo made our experience truely unforgettble. I would highyly recommend this hotel and we will definatey go back.Jesmindah S,Amersham| United Kingdom,08-06-13,No,5
friendly luxury,We stayed here between 5th and 15th May 2013 in one of the three bedroom villas and can not recommend the hotel highly enough.The villa was spacious and well thought out and our butler (Geraldine) was faultless| always happy to help but without being under our feet all the time. If you can afford it I would recommend the villas. They are slightly further away from the beach but feel very private and quiet and its nice to have your own pool. Plus you can have your breakfast on your deck instead of having to go to the restaurant.The main facilities were good with the buffet having plenty of choices even for the fussy eater in our party. If you want to eat at one of the specilaist restaurants you may need to book a couple of days in advance to ensure you get in.The main pool has good shallow areas for children and then a deeper area for the swimmers.The beach and pool area always had plenty of loungers and we didn't struggle to get five together every day. There is also a beach waiter service which is very helpful.I also visited the spa whilst there and felt this was the only area that perhaps did not live up to the rest of the hotel as the room I was treated in was quite clinical and the therapists chatted away in creole while I sat having my mani-pedi which left me feeling a little bit left out. The treatments themselves were good though.All in all the hotel is well thought out to give an air of privacy whilst providing everything you could wish for. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff.Thank you to all the staff there who made our holiday so enjoyable and especially Geraldine.,Amersham| United Kingdom,31-05-13,No,5

Most Relaxing Beach Resort.....,We chose Mauritius due to the weather and proximity to India| as it was our honey-moon and it had to be planned in the most perfect way....It had the perfect weather to enjoy our holiday in May and our beach resort didnt disappoint us at all.The temperature was between 22 deg to 28 deg throughout the day....We checked in to our hotel room 101 and it was an amazing room with everything that is required to enjoy a perfect holiday| that is relaxing as well as a neccesity......The hotel has six resturaunts cusines like - Italian|International|Indian|thai|continental and sea food.....The staff were very courteous in suggesting and altering the menu exactly like we wanted. We really appreciated the services of Teelasha and resturaunt managers - Anwar (Italian) and Chef Satish (Indian) as well as our service buddy at the deck - Kader.It was one of the most amazing experiences with free water sports like Water Ski| Snorkelling|para sailing and kayak pedalling. We enjoyed the dolphin ride to the Cataraman cruise organised by our tour operator Aquasun (who seem to guide us perfectly during our entire stay)The best experience was the beach dinner which the hotel offered us with a private table at the beach side with a personal musician. The entire arrangement as well as the service along with the best french Champagne was one of the most touching experiences....Overall a very clean and hygienic beach resort with very good facilities| most courteous staff and very romantic place to spend our honeymoon......Highly recommended and shall definitely visit again in future,New Delhi| India,25-05-13,No,5
LOOK NO FURTHER - THIS IS IT!,I am lucky enough to be able to travel the world and experience the finest in the hotel industry. I am lucky enough to stay in 5-start hotels every time I wish to do so - am I braggin? NO - wait there| there's a point to all this. Looking for a hotel in Mauritius can be a dauting task due to the sheer multitude of resorts available. Finding a BALANCE between top-level quality/luxury and price is an art form and| again| at the risk of sounding unbelievably obnoxious - I think I found it. The resort is situated NORTH WEST of the island - which is exactly where you want to be in Mauritius to avoid cold-ish south-easterly winds originating from the South Pole. Trou Aux Biches is the perfect location (I used to live in Mauritius and used to walk my dog there so trust me)| situated a 10 minute cab ride from the night life in Grand Baie. I can't say enough about the beauty of this hotel - stunning design| excellent choice (and quality) of food| beautifully appointed rooms. Go for the room with the out-door shower| there's nothing like taking a shower outdoors with the sound of the wind in the coconut trees and tropical birds singing. Don't worry. No one can see you!The beach is a picture-perfect dream of powdery white sand and crystal-clear water| with ''Castaway''-like views. The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful| and for those spa-hounds out there you've not experienced a spa quite like this one...absolute Nirvana! Now the best part: we flew in from Dubai for a long weekend with a couple of close friends and absolutely went all-out. We didn't count our money and ordered whatever we wanted when we felt like it. The total price for the stay ended up being cheaper (and far better value) than some of the 5-star hotels we've stayed at in Dubai| Hong-Kong| or Singapore. So| my point is| if you fancy 5-star luxury in paradise for the price of a 4-star: LOOK NO FURTHER - THIS IS IT!,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,24-05-13,No,5
A paradise in itself,"I & my wife visited trou aux biches last week and it would just superb to be there.The warmth you feel when u enter the property was amazing. Excellent hospitality and super trained staff.We stayed for 7 nights and couldn't find a single problem which we faced in this amazing resort.Our special thanks to Leckraj & Chef Satish who made sure that we were served on time and that too perfectly.The thai restaurant ""Blue Ginger"" is probably one of the best thai places I have visited uptil now.To add the health center was very well equipped and maintained. Tennis courts were of high level and very well kept. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to travel Mauritius.

FANTASTIC HOLIDAYS,My friend and I (2 women) just spent 13 nights at this fantastic hotel and loved every minute of it. The crew was great| the food excellent| we loved all the sport activities as well as the Spa and the courses. The restaurants were wonderful so was the whole setting and the room. The only negative thing is that the prices for the drinks and the suplements are rather high/ pricy.,Zürich| Zurich| Switzerland,21-05-13,No,5
Daughters Wedding 6 May 2013,We could not fault this resort. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Couldn't have asked for any more.

Wow| wow| wow .......,This was my 14th trip to the island having previously stayed at Four Seasons ( used to be my most recommended)| St Geran| Le Toussrok| Sofitel| Sugar Beach| Le Telfair| Paradis etcWe booked a senior suite and boy was this room better than the Four Seasons. Check the web video.The beach is on par with Paradis| which I previously rated the best on the island. There is a choice of 6 restaurants and the service unbelievable. Special mention goes to Leckraj and Fathima.I would go so far as to say this is probably one of the best all rounded resorts on the island. Did I mention an amazing beach and room.Be wary of using Mautourco. They messed my transfers from Le Victoria to TaB and I had to chase them to confirm my transfers to the airport. Even when I arrived they were unfriendly. Would not recommend this company at all.,Johannesburg| South Africa,17-05-13,No,5
Unforgettable moments,I would highly recommend this hotel to my fellow view as our unforgettable Wedding was held on this paradise island. The hotel has a stretch white sandy beach and several private pool.The main pool is cascade of water giving a great view.Rooms was well clean and Resto was very good. The main buffets Resto was nice.Attraction for sea sports is nerveless the best place to be,London| United Kingdom,09-05-13,No,5
Very nice place.,We are a couple with our teen girl (14) and we were lodged on a Beach Front Senior Suite with private pool.Let me summary our views on main points:Hotel and surroundingsTropical hotel with individual pavilions and villas.My congratulations to the hotel designer and for the landscape gardener. Obviously also congratulations for the people who take care every day of all the different plants and trees.Very| very nice and nite.The outside pavilions and villas with African inspiration are also very beautiful.Apart from the main infinity pool (fantastic)| there is some other pools| each one for a number of pavilions (very practical because the large extension of the resort). With luck| you will enjoy alone of the whole pool.Less positive is going from restaurants or main pavilion (which includes the hall| reception desk| concierge| jewelry and a gift shop) to villas when it rains... (there are golf cars| but sometimes you are not in the reception building and then you have to take your umbrella and run| since the distances are considerable.Tennis courts which we enjoyed very much.Spa very beautiful| but we didn’t use it.The beach is nice with available hammocks (very comfortable) and some sport waters free.Too much vendors| some of them very annoying.On the other hand| as the beach is public (although the hotel has security staff) it is very easy that anyone come in the hotel property.Villas:I do not know how the suites in the pavilions are| so I can not give an opinion.Our beach front senior suite has a big living room with a nice screen TV| 2 sofas (one of them was my daughter bed) and an armchair| big coffee table| fridge| Nespresso machine…Our bedroom has a very good size| with another huge TV screen| one armchair. The bed was big and very comfortable. We slept like babies…The bathroom is also enormous with nice round bathtub| separate shower and separate toilet.Big wash basins area.Also we have a big closet (enough for 3 adults) and a corner with a dressing table.Nice outdoor shower| nevertheless we hardly used it due to not very hot August temperatures.The suite combines elegance| modernity and comfort. I like it very much.Bedroom and living room lead to a big balcony with nice furniture (nice tables with a trunk as base) and a beautiful swing.Downstairs the balcony we have our private pool with correct sizes and also an area with 2 loungers. The water a little cold…Restaurants:In general we enjoyed very much our meals and the staff is attentive.-Blue Ginger restaurant (Thai). Good quality| but we didn’t repeat it.-Mahiya (Indian). Very nice atmosphere and nice food. We repeat it.-Il Corallo (Italian). Excellent antipasto. We also repeat it.-Le Deck (seafood). Excellent. We repeat it.-L’Oasis (buffet). Nice| but we only went when they did the thematic Mauritian night. Rest of days we prefer the other restaurants. The breakfast is served here and the quality of it is just passable.Negative points in restaurants: *Too much courses with overprice.*During the breakfast a l’Oasis| the birds catch all they can and I find it very unhygienic.*Le Deck is placed outside and every time we have dinner there| we have to run with chairs and tables under cover and we find this very unpleasant. It messed up the dinner.Let me mention the person in charge of refilling the minibars (I didn’t remember his name)| but he was super pleasant and well-mannered (without typing him). He deserves a salary rise.All in all| we enjoyed very much this fantastic hotel. We hope to repeat very soon!,San Francisco| California,08-05-13,No,4
Brilliant,I would recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking for a 5star chillaxing holiday. Overall service and stay was excellent. Professionalism at all levels of interaction with staff. Lots of entertainment. All water sports right on the beautiful beachfront with miles of white sandy beaches to take a nice stroll on. Awesome Spa treatments. ,Cape Town| Western Cape| South Africa,08-05-13,Yes,5
Still the best Hotel in Mauritius,It is our first visit after the hotel has been revamped. It is certainly different from the old one| but as good or even better. The accommodation is very comfortable and our room was neatly located next to one of the internal pools. The beach remains the same| and although you may be pestered by hawkers| I did not feel it to be any worse than previous years. To me the biggest difference is in the quality of the food. There are now a number of restaurants that produce consistently exceptional food. Our family favorites were the Italian| Thai and Indian restaurants. I did not have the opportunity to go to the spa| but certainly made extensive use of the Fitness Centre and the tennis courts. We found the staff to be be very attentive and professional. I would strongly recommend his hotel to all travelers. ,Shanghai| China,30-04-13,Yes,5
nice place to stay,the hotel is located in a very convenient location near Grand bay| all the services provided are excellent| waiters and waitress are nice| sands are beautiful| dinner is delicious| it is quite suitable for familis to stay in the hotel for holiday.,Shanghai| China,29-04-13,Yes,5
A perfect family escape,This was our third visit to Trou Aux Biches| and we will be back again. The blend of extreme comfort| with gorgeous surroundings and laid back atmosphere makes it a fantastic family destination. The beach is lovely and the pool a magnet for all children| the fact it is situated right on the beach means that we grown ups have no issue sitting there with the view of the ocean in front of you. The smaller pools situated in the gardens by the rooms are an added bonus and feel like a private garden oside of your door. The great kids club means that we could indulge in our love of diving - and the team that run the dive shop are excellent by any standards. We visited Trou Aux Biches pre- renovation and were concerned it would have lost its charm through such a big renovation. We had no need to be concerned| the team are as friendly as ever and they are what makes it.,London| United Kingdom,13-04-13,Yes,5
Amazing resort,We arrived at Trou Aux Biches the 21th of March to get celebrate our wedding. When we arrived at the hotel we were first mesmerized by the fantastic scenery of the hotel reception and the surrounding areas| it is extremely beautiful| well keeps| clean and the staff greeted us in such a professional way we felt we had landed in paradise.When we arrived at our room we were not disappointed! Really beautiful modern designed and the size of the room was impressive. The bathroom is almost the same size as the bedroom and the outdoor shower is an extremely nice touch. So my hat off to the designer| they have made the place so beautiful you just never want to leave. The rooms are surrounded by beautiful gardens and pools| just breathtaking. The resort is also located on one of the most beautiful beaches on the island| white beach that was kept clean every day and crystal clear water. The sunbeds were very comfortable and more than enough for all the guests so you never need to rush down in the morning to grab one. The service by the beach boy was also super and if we had left our towels he would get you new ones without hesitation.The restaurants were really nice. The interior/exterior decorations of the restaurants were again breathtaking! Every detail has been carefully considered and they have not saved at any corner| just perfect. We tried all the restaurants and would not be able to pick a favorite as they are all outstanding and provide you with a good variety 5 star quality dining it just a matter of preference. The food is really good and the atmosphere amazing. The staff provides an excellent service!! I am still amazed how at all time and at any location in the resort you are greeted with a smile and service I thought were only reserved for royalties. It seemed to me that they were all proud of their job and were happy so show you the best they could be| and did it all with a smile and warm welcome.I think I am like most brides; I would like my wedding to be a day to remember. As I have mentioned before| the hotel itself is so exclusive and beautiful that the setting and venue does provide a fantastic frame to the wedding. The hotels staff and wedding planner have experience in arranging weddings so they are extremely professional and think about every detail to make the wedding just perfect. I have to mention Natallje my wedding planner and Jerome manager at the Caravel whom were just fantastic throughout. Nothing was impossible| I was quite demanding but still I did not experience one time were my request was refused. The wedding ceremony was arranged on the beach and was so beautiful it brought tear to my eyes when I walked up towards it. All the staff took extremely well care of our 7 guests that are so happy with the experience at Trou Aux Biches that they would all like to return. The photographer they provided was very experienced and took the most amazing pictures. After our ceremony there was cake and champagne on the beach and when my husband and myself was off for a photo session our guests were escorted to the bar were a table with cakes and drinks was waiting.The dinner was prepared on the beach outside the Caravel restaurant. Again| breathtaking| flower arrangements everywhere| bonfire and touches made the dining area on the beach look like something out of a fairytale!! Next to the dining tables that had prepared a lounge were we were greeted with aperitifs and a spectacular show with flame dancers| I would highly recommend this as it started of the evening in a spectacular way. The dinner was just AMAZING and during the entire meal the staff was constantly making sure everyone had something in their glasses. They were extremely professional in the senesce that no speech was interrupted and every course was served with good intervals. After dinner we moved over to the beautiful lounge were small cakes was served and a champagne bottle brought inn for me to sabrage. This idea was nothing I would have thought of myself but the manager Jerome thinks about everything and has customer's satisfaction as his number one priority. So| as I was sabring the champagne Jerome had arranged for a boat with firework just outside the beach from where we were seated to start the firework the second the champagne bottle was sabraged. Then we all enjoyed 5 minute of a spectacular firework show! I have seen many fireworks but nothing like this....it was AMAZING and worth every penny! Both my husband and I and all our guests were stunned by it all and our guests are still talking about our amazing fairytale wedding.The staff and management can be proud to be a part of such an excellent 5 star establishment and are the key to many people's happy holiday experience and wedding celebration.I could thank so many people for they effort to make the holiday and wedding for my husband and I and all our friends an unbelievable experience but I have to again thank Natallje| Jerome and Fatima for their incredible effort and work to make it such a memorable experience for us all.We would definitely return to Trou Aux Biches| but next time we will for sure rent a villa they look amazing.,Oslo| Norway,13-04-13,Yes,5
Gorgeous| relaxing resort!,We have just returned from a great week at this resort in Mauritius. We stayed in a 2 bedroom family suite and it was fantastic. The kids had their own bedroom and bathroom with twin beds| shower| separate toilet. Our bedroom and bathroom were huge with a separate toilet and full bath as well as inside and outdoor showers - bliss!!! The suite was very well equipped with amenities as well as tea/coffee making facilities and minibar in both rooms. Loads of power points around the room which were most welcome with all the electronics we seem to travel with these days so we were not all fighting over one plug point! The beach in front of the resort is lovely and much nicer than the beach further up near Le Cardinale. The complimentary watersports offered by the hotel were great although they are only open during certain times each day which was not made clear to us when we made the booking or on arrival at the hotel. There a 6 restaurants in the hotel and we ate at 5 of them and all very good meals but service a little slow in a couple of them. All in all| a gorgeous resort in which to relax and chill!,Umhlanga Rocks| South Africa,12-04-13,Yes,5
Family friendly on beautiful beach.,Nice hotel on one of Mauritius best beaches. Love the situation on the island as well| with short driving distance to Grand Baie and Port Louis.Modern and fresh consept and rooms. I like that the rooms are divided in smaller aereas with its own pool and garden| it gives this very large hotel a more intimate feel.The food was good| but unfortunatly the main restaurant was not up to standard. The service and cleaning off tables was poor| and it seemed to be understaffed.Therefore we mainly ate at La Caravelle| where the service was excellent both during breakfast and dinner.The children loved the hotel| the overall lay out and the Family Apartment was very family friendly.All in all a very nice stay at a hotel I absolutly will reccomend.,London| United Kingdom,09-04-13,Yes,5
Wonderful family holiday destination with one or two minor complaints,The Trou Aux Biches is a fabulous hotel. The beach is amazing and reports of being hassled by people selling is in my opinion over exaggerated. The swimming pool was gorgeous and brilliant for my two year old who could safely wander around the huge shallow pool which surrounds the main pool. The family suite was superb and there were lovely touches in the kids ensuite bathroom such as a slightly lower toilet and sink for the little ones. The restaurants were all of a high standard and they were very accommodating with my requests for my youngest and my other two fussy eaters. As with any resort it wasn't perfect you were given your beach towels in the bedroom so when you headed for breakfast in the morning with three kids in tow it wasn't ideal that you had to carry your towels down with you (the hotel is quite vast and our room was a golf buggy ride away from the main breakfast and pool). If you try and get towels by the pool you're in for quite a wait which is annoying. There was no waiter service around the pool which I found surprising. No nice touches you get in other 5* hotels around the pool such as cold face towels being handed out or fruit skewers. As we were there out of season the hotel was predictably quiet but we still found the service slow at the Deck restaurant next to the swimmng pool. However with these few complaints we'd still go back. The hotel staff were very friendly and the kids really enjoyed the kids club giving us a few hours off to ourselves. It's a really great family resort but it does lack sophistication in some areas. If you do book make sure you pack insect repellent as the mosquitos were pretty annoying!,London| United Kingdom,27-03-13,No,4
Paradise wedding,We have just got back from what must be one of the best hotels on the planet - Trou aux Biches Resort. The quality of the accomodation is breathtaking. Huge bedrooms| gorgeous bathrooms. We had the tropical junior suite with a lovely outdoor shower area. The suites have such a private feel and are very quiet. Each one is close to a gorgeous swimming pool and the beach. The grounds are beautiful. So many flowers| the gardeners are clearly very talented. Loads of palm trees everywhere and so many colourful little birds. The beach itself is superb. Best beach I have ever been to. Soft white sand| such blue sea. The snorkelling is good| we saw a purple jellyfish| seasnakes| loads of humbug fish| loads of other colourful creatures. The wedding was organised so well| the staff at Trou aux Biches are FANTASTIC. Service was amazing| we were treated like royalty. I must thank the following people who each helped to make our stay even more special. The wedding co-ordinators Winny-Jane and Natanielle| Fatima the Assistant Manager who was incredible| Deborah and Wendy in the Spa| Lina in Housekeeping who made us a lovely towel swan with flowers from the gardens| Raffick the friendly mini-bar man| Vishnu who gave us free cocktails in the bar and Sadeck from the Italian restaurant - fantastic service. The food is generally excellent although if there was one point Trou aux Biches could improve on| for me it would be this. Breakfasts were excellent| tonnes of choice and all of spectacular quality. Lunch really let it down| we were on full board plus but rarely ate lunch as I am vegetarian and there was literally nothing unless I had a pizza. (Not really what you fancy in 30 degree heat!) It would have been lovely to just have a simple salad for lunch or something. Dinners in the 6 restaurants were generally amazing. Just wish that there had been slightly more choice for me. The Italian the the Indian were fine but the Thai and the buffet literally had nothing for me| even the salads had meat in. I understand that most vistors to Trou aux Biches are French and South African (big meat eaters) but this was still a bit disappointing. However| I am quick to point out that this in no way impacted the amazingness of the rest of it! I just made quite a few trips to the supermarket :)The kindness and thoughtfulness of the staff at Trou aux Biches in making our wedding perfect will stay with me forever. We had loads of extras| champagne in the room on arrival| a huge bouquet of flowers in the room after the ceremony| and after our dinner on the beach in the evening| we got back and found that someone had run us a bath with loads of red rose petals in and all over the bathroom floor. Amazing!! All in all| this is by far the best hotel I have every stayed in and I would have no hesitation in rrecommending it to anyone.,London| United Kingdom,25-03-13,No,5
Poor,Spent a week in December regrettably at this hotel.accomodation was superb but unfortunately this was all that was.Occupancy during peak season about 30% leading to closure of main restaurant and relocation to smaller la caravelle.Service truly appalling|the less said the better!Beach not user friendly next to public beach and vendors constantly harassing one even whilst asleep on chaise-lounge. In short expensive and unpleasant and not to be recommended. Roger Phillips,Johannesburg| South Africa,21-03-13,No,1
Great time at Trou Aux Biches Resort,We have just return from our 2weeks stay at Trou Aux Biches Resort & Spa and when I look out of the window where is just snowing I would like to be back. Mauricius is great green island and Trou Aux Biches Resort is one of its pearls.We stayed in Tropical Junior Suite close to the La Caravele restaurant and beach. Very good location. The room was a perfect size about 70m2 with teracce| big bathroom and outside tropical shower; a simple but functional furniture; we would appreciate just maybe more storage space....Exterior was gorgeous. All bungalows and villas are spaced in beautiful garden which is well maintained. The bungallows are spaced around 5 garden pools which are almost empty and ideal for early evening swimming with sound of nature and birds around you. The hotel has four ala carte restaurant. We aren´t funs of Indian cuisine so we didn´t try Mahiya restaurant. But I can highly recommend La Caravelle (international)| Il Corallo (Italian) and Blue Ginger (Thai). Every food we tasted was delicious. And their freshly baked bread ... hm. Hotel beach is very nice| daily cleaned and quite long. As all beaches are public on Mauricius you can´t avoid the local souvenir sellers. But if you tell you aren´t interested they won´t bother you. Some of them are very funny and I think they speak all languages. They are well prepared for tourists.And you must definitely experience their Spa and fitness which was very good equipped.But the hotel would be worthless without good| friendly| trained and helpful staff. And this is big advantage of TAB. Or it was our experience. Especially staff at La Caravelle restaurant and bar and Il Coralo restaurant where we were regular visitors. Messrs Wishnu| Sadeck and Kevin were great and if I was a restaurant owner I would definitely hire them. But all staff members at these restaurants were great but these three guys are unforgettable for me. So thanks for our splendid days at TAB| which will definetely return.,Prague| Czech Republic,18-03-13,No,5
A trip to paradise,We went to Mauritius 16 years ago and enjoyed it (but not at this Hotel)This hotel and its environment are absolutely beautiful. All the rooms have Wi-Fi and if you are a sad soul like me handy to keep in touch with the office on the laptop. The better suites have an outside shower – fabulous (no you are not on display!) and the best ones even have a small plunge pool as well. The beds are huge (almost couldn’t find my wife!). All rooms are in small units of around four – two ground and two first. Each ‘pod’ of about 10 buildings has its own pool| which is very idyllic private and quiet| but why would you want a pool when such a glorious beach is to hand?You can either have your lounger on the beach or just back in small areas just behind amongst the palms for extra shade. The hotel has an onsite dive site that is beautifully equipped with very good (and new) kit – although we took most of our own. There are loads of facilities – I really can’t think of any they missed.The people are just absolutely lovely and charming – all of them from the chambermaids to the managers and everyone in-between. The service is first rate. There is a choice of restaurants| and the self-serve buffet is really top rate. Tip – book the full board plus. There isn’t a lot of eating places around and on full board plus you get a bottle of wine a day plus a glass or a beer at lunchtime and plenty of water included. (We are now on strict diets!!) The house Cabernet is South African and really great – highly recommended!There are very few ‘cons’. The swimming areas are cordoned off to separate you from the boats – of which there are too many and the sections are not worth snorkelling as there is just a sandy bottom. Away from the hotel it is better| but just be careful there could be stonefish away from the hotel area. The other restaurants (apart from the buffet) have fixed menus. There is an Italian| Thai| Indian and French.If you want a rave up night life – go elsewhere. They do have music at night but in general it was poorly attended| although the Independence Day celebrations were great.What a contrast from Thailand! (Where we went last year). Climate much better| not so humid and it has the good grace to rain mainly at night – if it rains at all. There is no sleaze or the sort of naff stuff you find in Far East resorts. There is much more of an air of class and sophistication – probably because there are many French (the main language – although everyone also speaks English) and you don’t get the sort of yobs that are so prevalent in the Far East. (Yes – I don’t like the Far East at all). Grand Bay nearby is really quite elegant. Shopping is fantastic as much of the genuine designer gear is made in Mauritius – shop around for the best reals. My Mrs got quite excited as she knows about this sort of thing and said the stuff was genuine and less than half the cost than in Europe.If you want a beach holiday with lovely scenery in a beautiful (large) island with lovely people in a great hotel withj wonderful surroundings – book it!,London| United Kingdom,18-03-13,No,5
Best holiday ever,We had the pleasure to spend a week at Trou aux Biches Resort in October 2012. Mauritius is a beautiful island with amazing weather. But this is not the only reason we had the best holiday ever| this resort is just amazing with wonderful facilities| lovely| helpful and very professional members of staff. A special thank you to Madame Fatima and her team (special thanks to Jerome| Winny-Jane and Chef Paul...) for our amazing stay there.We are a picky couple and literally read through all the reviews of pretty much every resort on the island before choosing Trou aux Biches. We are fortunate enough to have had the chance to stay at a lot of different 5 stars resorts around the world (including Mauritius a long time ago) and this is by far the best we have ever been to.Rooms: from the standard room to the highest category they are all amazing| very big| very clean and well maintained (the resort has been refurbished few years ago) and very quiet with all rooms giving you an amazing view (whether it's on the garden or on the beach) yet still provide privacy.Food: wonderful fresh food served everyday| with a wide choice across the numerous restaurants. The quality of the service and of the food is far above any resort restaurant we have ever been to and similar to some michelin star restaurants in London (the long hours spent at the gym when we came back can testify of it).Staff: Beyond the beauty of the island and the resort (located on the award winning beach of Trou aux Biches) the staff is the jewel of this resort. Every member of staff including top management in this resort provide a service at the highest standard and beyond your expectation| everyone is extremely helpful| nice and professional and will make sure you have a wonderful stay. Every request we had was granted with pleasure and care. All this contributed to making it our best holiday ever| but the real test| will we come back? Most definitely yes. We loved it so much and are lucky enough to go back to Trou aux Biches to get married later this year. Special thanks again to everyone for making our stay unforgettable. We can't wait to return!,London| United Kingdom,17-03-13,No,5
Hotel prefect but didn't like the coral on the beach,Came back last week from a fabulous 6 day trip here. This has to be one of the best resort hotels we have ever been to. We have been on several of these types of holidays in various countries. Not sure its very Mauritian though as you could have been anywhere in the tropical world! We opted for the lowest room category and were pleased to get upgraded. Thoroughly enjoyed the tropical shower! The room was huge| exceptionally clean with all the extras you could ever want. The bed was massive and very comfy. The whole resort was in first class condition. We ate in all the restaurants apart from the night buffet. Every meal was excellent. We made reservations one day in advance as we wanted to make sure we could try all the restaurants. Each night we ate at 7.30pm because you choose your table on arrival at the restaurants so being one of the first to arrive meant we got the best table every night. Ended up eating in the most amazing locations. Found virtually all of the staff to be very efficient and friendly. We chose the full plus package and think we did it justice. Ate so much and the wines on offer were very pleasant. Had been concerned about weather forecast before we went but we had one cloudy day though it still was a beach day and the rest were fine. Had a few showers but they only lasted about 5 minutes and it was really refreshing to have some rain fall on you. The hotel only own the beach to high water mark so it's a public beach. It was good to see local people also getting to use their own beach and not just tourists who can afford to pay. It was brilliant for people watching. Unfortunately whilst we were staying there was a group of at least 60 Italians at the hotel being SO loud joining together in large groups| totally spoiling the calm ambience of the beach. The top part of the beach where the sun loungers are placed was perfect but it is a narrow strip. This then gives way to rougher sand with loads of dead coral which extends right into the sea. Once in the sea there are patches of softer sand but still lots of coral and some small rocks. I cut my feet several times. The hotel staff did rake the beach daily to remove some of the coral but being a natural phenomenem there is little that can be done. It is a shame because we came across some much better stretches of beach on our morning walks up the coast. You can walk for several miles. Having a perfect beach is really important to me and this would be the only reason that I probably wouldn't return. Everything else really was first class. The hotel was so lovely that we didn't want to take too much time away but we did take a trip to Grand Baie using the taxi organised by the hotel. We felt the taxi was extremely overpriced. The driver waited in Grand Baie for us even though it was only about 10 minutes away which is why it cost 1000 rupees.,Scotland,15-03-13,No,5
Beyond all expectations!,"I traveled here in February 2013 with my girlfriend. Since this was our first ""big"" trip together| we wanted to book something special and perhaps a little nicer that what we usually do. Therefore| our expectations where definitely a little higher as this hotel is slightly on the pricey side (however| still not bad considering what you get). Based on experience| the pictures the hotel show on their website are normally photoshoped and not representative. This is not the case for Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa. It is even better that the photos. The standard of the hotel was way better that we could have imagined. The staff were as friendly as they get. The beach is superb. The food is to die for. Overall| this hotel surpassed any of our expectations by a looong mile. Highly recommended.",Germany,15-03-13,No,5

wonderful week for couple in amazing beachfront junior suite,We spent a great 8 days at this resort in late february. Our large beachfront junior suite was superb with its incredible bathroom| outdoor shower and private plunge pool. The resort was about 50 percent full so no problem ever getting a beach lying chair or pool lying chair. The pool is very large| a joy to swim in and was never very full. Our junior beachfront suite was located in a wonderful position as we were close to main pool and facilities but not too close. The resort is very large and it woud make a difference where your room is located. Would not want to be too far away from main pool area. The resort was kept in excellent condition and is almost new anyway so beautiful facilities and ambience. The service throughout the resort was excellent. One suggestion that we kept wishing for .... Why not have a pool/beach towel hut located near the main pool area for guests to get fresh beach/pool towels? We felt this was needed. We had half board; breakfast and dinner and the selection of food was vast so although the majority of dishes included seafood which we do not eat there was always something for us to choose. However we did think that some of the supplements for some items on the menu at the various restaurants seemed unfairly high. Overall this was minor and we had a spectacular holiday and cant wait to return. Thanks for a magical week.,sydney,14-03-13,No,5

Amazing pool,Great hotel overall! There is a amazing swimming pool. The beach is great| and the sea incredible. The only thing is public who are not staying in the hotel are not allowed on the beach| but they come anyway and they are not strictly forbidden. So they block the view of the sea and talk a lot. There is an amazing range of activities on the beach including water skiing| parasailing| tubing| pedal boating and much more. The restaurant la deck is really good but quite simple. The bar is very nice at night as there is live music and cocktails. The buffet restaurant is incredible as the food is based on a different country every day. And then there is a really good Italian restaurant which is perfect for children or lunchtime. The Indian restaurant is not great as it was quite disappointing. However the Thai restaurant is amazing| but it is annoying having a set menu. The rooms are amazing and the tropical shower is magical. The mini club for kids is great and the kids love it and don't want to leave. The teens club is run by a really nice lady who connects with the teens| but it is not as fun| the hotel are improving this so it will be sorted. Overall an amazing holiday recommended for couples and families.,turku,21-02-13,No,4

Paradise and service to match !,We recently returned from this hotel after experiencing almost perfect service| location| accommodation and amazing food.It is almost impossible to find fault.The staff were truly amazing| but the food| where you have a choice of 6 restaurants to choose from| was just truly a gourmet delight.I cannot praise this hotel enough.If you are planning a 5 star vacation' you need look no further.You will not be disappointed !!,Wolverhampton| United Kingdom,01-02-13,No,5
Wonderful place,We have just returned from a 16 night holiday here at the Troux Aux Biches. We had the luxury of a Senior Suite as we were celebrating my husband’s big birthday!!! The room was fantastic| we had a large patio and a plunge pool the food was to die for and the staff very good. I spent a lot of time swimming to keep the weight down!! My husband enjoyed the windsurfing facilities and Baboo who ran the sports centre certainly had the place in ship shape order. Safety was very important to them all. The snorkelling beyond the reef was fabulous; it was like swimming inside an aquarium.We spent hubby’s birthday in the “Kiosk” at the La Caravelle restaurant which was our favourite place. The food was excellent along with the staff| try the local rum to make a Bar tenders drink. Enjoy!,Camberley| United Kingdom,30-01-13,No,5
Great Hotel on a great beach,This is a top resort hotel. It has 6 wonderful restaurants serving fantastic food. The room we had (306) was on the beach and right by the pool. It was large and spotless. The staff are all very friendly and eager to please. The beach is good for walking and swimming| although there is some coral washed up which is rather sharp. The beach is public which is not a problem apart from the sellers who walk up and down| can be a pain!,Telford| United Kingdom,30-01-13,No,5
Gorgeous resort on a gorgeous beach!,"We stayed at this resort for one week for a special birthday celebration| and LOVED it. We had a beachfront bungalow| and really liked our unit as (unlike some others) it was private and at the end of the row and so not viewed by passers-by on the resort's walkways. The unit had a nice patio with plunge pool| although we didn't use the pool much (other than to rinse our feet) because it was a bit cold (in September). This resort was refurbished in recent years| and is absolutely gorgeous| with pools of water everywhere| lovely Asian open wood buildings (reception| restaurants| etc)| beautiful trees and manicured lawns and flowers| and a clean beach (which is raked each day by staff). We tried all of the restaurants and thought they were all great (bookings often required)| although we did not re-visit the main buffet after trying it one night| as we found it a big too big and ""family friendly"" (a lot of little kids running around)| for our needs. We loved the beach| the gym| tennis courts| restaurants. A major highlight for us was going out with a couple of boat guys who troll along this beach (licensed) to look for dolphins| etc. They tooks us out (usually on our own) to swim with schools of dolphins when they knew they were in the area. we also did the daily snorkle trips offered (included) by the resort| and these were usually very nice. The resort is very big| but spread out and (other than at breakfast) you are not necessarily aware of how many people are there. (we were also there in mid-late-Sept| which is not peak season). We loved it| and hope to go back!",USA and South Africa,24-01-13,No,5
Excellent resort for those who don't mind spending more... You get what you pay for...,This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in... Excellent food choice| fantastic pool and beach| courteous and professional staff| great for honeymooners| 10 min by taxi to gran baie.. Has been renovated 2yrs ago and looks in great condition | not the cheapest hotel but you will not be disappointed If you don't mind spending a bit more..,London| United Kingdom,24-01-13,No,5
Amazing resort| has it ALL!!,Trou aux Biches has it all. An amazing resort| beautiful and elegant. Huge but quiet. Greens and flowers all over the resort. Kind and helpful staff. Excellent cuisine. 9 tennis courts| SPA by Clarins| impressive rooms. And most of all| THE BEST SANDY BEACH on the island. Dont waste your time to find a better beach. Also the pool is propably one of the best. Expensive but it worths it! The only annoying thing is that at the beach there are plenty of local itinerant tradesmen who they dont leave you easily to relax... Sometimes is better to have a sunbed at the pool area and go from there to the sea for swim.,Nicosia| Cyprus,23-01-13,No,5
Fantastic hotel and service,We stayed in the hotel in January for 10 nights 5 of us with parents and our son and we truly loved it! It was one of our best holidays ever. We generally travel a lot and like high standard of service| accommodation and food| and this place covers it all! Hotel is beautiful| spreader in amazing gardens full of plants and flowers - well kept. There are beautiful pools spreader through out the resort so you can swim anywhere you like all the time. Rooms are nice and spacious with very minimalistic design| but you have all you need. The only thing I would add here is some colour or a flower to lighten up the rooms. We had half board and we were really nicely surprised with the selection and quality of food and service| you can eat in all 6 restaurants where all have great food and big variety. Service is excellent! What is nice surprise is also a prices of wine for example as prices are very generous and selection of very wide. There is not a one complain about the restaurants or food - well gone.Beach is relatively narrow and very long all along the resort with nice walk path around the beach. The only concern we had were many corals on the beach that are not always pict up or can not be easily picked up| so when going with kids its recommended to take a water shoe as some corals are pretty sharp. Also be aware that this beach is public so you see many local crafts and cloth salesman walking and offering stuff which at time can be a bit annoying| but can be ignored. The hotel itself is closed by to a small tourist town Grand Bay| nice place to visit for souvenirs shopping or restaurant experience. We rented a car also so had nice experience driving around the island - highly recommended.,Nicosia| Cyprus,20-01-13,No,5
Aaahhhhh bliss!,"We stayed here early January 2013 for 10 days.Holidays wuith 2 young kids (4 & 7) are normally not a time for rest for the parents| but boy was this a welcome time for me to be proven wrong on that front.I can make this review all about the wonderfull facilities at Trou Aux Biches Resort & Spa| which it certainly was. But for me the fact that our kids WANTED to spend time at the Bob Marlin kiddies club| with all their exciting daily activities and excursions| allowed mom and myself to get some reading done| sip a few ice cold drinks by the pool side and basically just ""chill"".I suppose the addage that "" you are only as happy as your unhappiest child"" holds very true.I do not want to detract from the fact that the family suites were righ on the beach and they were beautifully appointed| each with their own pool.The restaurants were brilliant and we did not have a single unpleasant meal during our visit.The staff were friendly and always helpfull.If I am to find fault| then it was that during morning breakfast (buffet) the service was a little lacking| but I suppose if you consider the amount of meals they serve and people coming through in the morning| then I can't really call that a complaint.Be sure to take the boat ride (not included in the price) to go and watch the dolphins| well worth it.",Johannesburg| South Africa,18-01-13,No,5
Outstanding,We stayed here over Christmas 2012 (family of 6) for 13 nights and we had the best time.The hotel is beautiful| the food in all the restaurants was genuinely excellent (and we're foodies with v high standards here) and the staff friendly.The rooms we had were very modern| espEcially the bathrooms| and the outside shower (cleverly screened) was a nice touch. Plenty of space in the whole resort.It's a fabulous setting| you can walk about a mile along the beach (which is a public beach).There are loads of sunbeds so there was never any need to 'bag a bed' - even when the hotel was full over Christmas.The wifi was patchy at best| the drinks service by the pool or on the beach not what you'd expect from a hotel of this standard and prices but that aside it was a top place and we'll definitely be going back.My wife cooo'ed about the spa and how lovely it was.,Solihull| United Kingdom,01-01-13,No,5
loved every minute,I went last year in August with my boyfriend| unfortunately in august the weather is not the best| but loved this resort! Its amazing how big this place is. The buffet breakfast is fantastic lots to choose from| we also really enjoyed have different choices to choose from for dinner. The pools are amazing! as well as the location of the beach. They also have a great gym and tennis courts to use as well as spa therapy place. However i don't recommend the hairdressers there| they really had no idea...The rooms are large| and amazing bathrooms! would love to go back there!,Melbourne| Australia,27-12-12,No,5
The best holiday,We have stayed for 2 weeks in December 2012 in the junior suite. The hotel is excellent in so many different ways. The accommodation is thought through down to smallest details.The food is of excellent quality. Exactly how I like it| not too much and nothing to choose from but a smaller buffet or restaurant with a few but excellent choices.The beach is award winningThe staff are absolutely superb. Well educated| well spoken| proud of their job| providing a top notch service with dignity| without being subservient. Nothing is too much trouble. Everyone goes the extra mile to make your holiday experience enjoyable and make you feel special.What I felt in this hotel in Mauritius that I have not had anywhere else in the world is the underlying philosophy of holiday| such as you are on holiday| therefore| you are here to relax and we are here to provide the best experience for you. Even the beach hawkers are nice about it!I was in awe of how they do business in the hotel and how everyone treats you.We have used the spa for 4 or 5 treatments during our stay. It is brilliant too.,Leicester| United Kingdom,18-12-12,No,5
Simple| as good as possible,We stayed 8 nights in two junor beach suites having connected door| At start| we had family room but upon request we were upgraded there by a reasonable price. Spacous| beautyful| clean. It was amazing we could enjoy the view with birds| palms| the sea| white sand| calm water (We were there early Nov probably the best time : warm and dry) . The pools were heated. The beverages were expensive| about 6 times higher than if I had walked out for 5 minutes distance to chez popo and buyed some. Even draught beer at the beach mobil was cheaper than the minibar. Do not travell to see a better beach.even if you could find one (i do not think) you do not have the comfort level|watersport are ok | free waterski| catamaran| etc.The foods were okThe crew was just fantastic they are for you. thank you,budapest,02-12-12,No,5
Fantastic hotel and overall holiday,We have just got back from a 10 night stay at Trou Aux Biches and agree with the vast majority of reviews already on TripAdvisor - this is a fantastic hotel in all respects.The beach is beautiful| the gardens are lovely and the food is absolutely excellent!We stayed in a junior suite (the basic room) and were very impressed! The bathroom was huge| with an open shower and a separate bathtub. The room itself was also very big and contemporary. Although| we did not see any of the more expensive rooms on the inside| our room was so nice that we are not sure of the point of an upgrade!I don't want to repeat too much of what's already on here but in to give people an idea of costs - main courses at lunch start at around £12| local beer is around £3.50 and soft drinks about £2 - all of which is pretty standard at a 5 star hotel.The main point I will add is about the weather in Mauritius itself rather than the hotel. Please do not be put off by any long-term weather forecasts! We checked almost everyday before we left and it was supposed to rain and have thunderstorms each day (according to numerous sites) - in fact it only really rained once and that was at 5pm. Every day was very sunny in the morning and became a bit cloudy around 3pm. We've added a few pictures to our review and would say that if you are considering booking| do not hesitate - you will love this hotel (and many of the guests there were repeat customers)!,HERTFORDSHIRE,30-11-12,No,5
Beautiful,We spent our holiday at the Trou aux Biches Resort last year. The hotel had just undergone extensive renovations. Our suite| especially the bathroom with outside shower| was amazing - very modern| rather minimalist| large and clean. The beach-facing terrace with a little pool was lovely. I enjoyed watching and listening to the small colourful birds. The beautiful beach was just a few steps away.There was a wonderful secluded pool very nearby. I had it to myself every morning before breakfast - it was magical.The gym was also empty in the morning - perfect.There were a few small service issues but overall we had a wonderful holiday!,Worcester| United Kingdom,25-11-12,No,5
Amazing Wedding Location,"We were married on the beach at this beautiful hotel in May this year with some 16 wedding guests in attendance (the biggest wedding the hotel has ever hosted - usually the wedding couple only). The beach front villa we stayed in was everything we expected it to be| the spa facilities were very good as were the wedding related services we received in the spa. (A special mention to Debbie in the spa who did an excellent job with wedding hair and make up| and all under the watchful eyes of a photographer and videographer| without a hint of distraction or self-consciousness). During our entire stay we could not fault the food in the restaurants| it truly is excellent whether a light lunch or three course dinner in any of the restaurants| including on our wedding night when we were served a private BBQ on the beach. The chef and his assistants provided us with an amazing meal. If you are reading this review and wondering about the wedding day extras| I hired the sega dancers as a surprise for my husband and our wedding guests - they are fantastic - beautifully dressed| great dancers and they really added something of the island spirit to the evening. Highly recommended. If| like us you invite wedding guests to your special day I can also recommend letting a bridesmaid or best man in on your plans - whilst the wedding co-ordinator probably did her best she wasn't able to cope with our mantra of ""simple beach wedding"" and tried to embellish / change altogether things we had decided in her own way - so if you want to have the day exactly as you planned I recommend charging someone with the responsibility of keeping her in check! That said we have wonderful memories of our stay including our wedding day and will return for an anniversary at some point| I am sure.",Dubai| United Arab Emirates,22-11-12,No,5
The Romantic Soul of Mauritius,Mauritius has some outstanding and first class hotels| and one of the best has to be Trou aux Biches. Located on the island’s North-west coast| Trou aux Biches is close to the lively village of Grand Bay.I first visited the hotel just over 5 years ago | and enjoyed an unforgettable honeymoon here.The hotel has since undergone extensive renovations and has literally been rebuilt. I returned here earlier in the year and was completely blown away.The hotel is gorgeous| stylish and yet trendy too - perfect for families and honeymooners. The hotel offers an impressive choice of accommodation from Beachfront Suites with their own plunge pools to two and three-bedroom family villas. For family holidays there’s even a complimentary children’s and teenagers club. The junior standard suites(where I stayed)| are huge and spacious with a giant king-size bed| patio| huge bathroom with an outside and inside shower as well as a bath.They have all the luxuries one could ask for - minibar air-conditioning| ceiling fan| TV| tea/coffee station| wi-fi| ipod docking station| safe| hairdryer| gowns and slippers and some wonderful bathroom amenities.The hotel has an amazing choice of 6 restaurants including the two buffet options. Bookings are required for the non-buffet restaurants and you can either eat a la carter| or on a set menu(part of your full board package). I tried out a few... The Indian Restaurant which was wonderful and my husband even got to play an Indian musical instrument.The Thai restaurant was also delicious and the service was impeccable.The Italian seemed a very popular option with some delicious pastas and mains - I'm not even going to mention the deserts!The hotel offers tennis courts| a fully equipped gym | steam room| sauna and a spa (Clarins). There really is plenty for you to enjoy here| from a cooling dip in one of the six garden pools| to joining in numerous free land and water sports| or just relax and enjoy the hotels outstanding setting.Most of the water sports are free including water ski-ing and sailing. As a keen sailor| the lagoon in front of the hotel is perfect for a scooting along on a hobie 14 or a laser...Also on offer is a trip on the glass bottom boat(twice a day)| windsurfing| kayaking and pedalo boats. There is also a snorkel boat that goes out twice a day to the reef - outside the reef if the weather conditions are good. This trip also includes a mask| snorkel and flippers - really handy if you don't have your own. The reef is not as good as the outer islands or in the south| but you still get to see quite a good variety of fish.Scuba diving is also available from the boat house at an additional cost.The hotel is set on one of the best beaches in Mauritius and there is nothing better than an early morning walk along the shore| or sitting on the beach watching the sun set. There are plenty of loungers and thatched umbrellas available| as well as beach towels.If you don't feel like going to the nearby markets in Grand Bay| then you can buy a whole range of local crafts and clothing from the local beach sellers who wander up and done ( this is strictly controlled and operate on a permit basis| so you never feel hassled or annoyed).All in all| a really lovely hotel - sheltered from the trade winds all year round| so a good choice no matter when you visit. The staff were really friendly and nothing was ever too much bother - really true Mauritian hospitality. A must for anyone craving a well deserved break in the sunshine,Cape Town Central| South Africa,22-11-12,No,5
Amazing,Amazing.What else to describe our Vacation.After a 4 Hour flight we arrived in Mauritius @19-30.We were out of the Airport approx 15 minutes.We were then met by our Transfer Car and taken to the Hotel.The journey took us approx 55 mins.Tired as we were the Magic was about to the start.Belinda from reception welcomed us.after a quick signature and then escorted to Dinner..Tired as we were |we enjoyed the eats and proceeded to our Room(Tropical Junior Suite).This is a huge suite that comes with an Outside Shower(Heaven)fully fitted bathroom with additional shower faclities.Adequate hanging space/bar size fridge/tea coffee facilty and safety box.Bedding was outstanding also comes with a TV.Setting of this resort is done so well that a sense of privacy is of paramount importance.Each set of units has a swimming pool.For the sports minded |there a Tennis Courts and the usual water sports and of come with a SPA.We opted for the half board option (Breakfast and Dinner).We ate all our meals at the Oasis Restaurant which serves on a buffet basis.An outstanding selection that caters for all Dietary requirements.A specail mention to be made of Noorally(Chef)Jay and Balraj and staff that nothing was impossible.Thanks guys for our specail request you made it happen!!!!!. NO PROBLEM as they say in Mauritian style with a huge smile.The resort has a great beach and comes with brochure type of sand.This Hotel is part of a chain(8) and has a interchange policy subject to availibilty.Meals can be interchanged as well.Please note that the Hotel also offers an inclusive and inclusve plus option.Lunch/selcted drinks/ pizza/ice cream and every day top up of the Mini Bar.Will we go back and be spoilt again-A RESOUNDING yes. The saddest part of our vacation was to say good bye to our new found friends.,Durban| South Africa,19-11-12,No,5
Best vacation ever,"A wonderful hotel | fantastic beaches| excellent restaurants and unique staff thanks to Fatima | Xavier and special mention to Jerome who has organised an unforgettable dinner on the beach for my wife's birthday with fireworks| an incredible experience!!!!I love to drink Margaritas as used in the U.S and Mexico. Unfortunatly they serve Margaritas the French way : a short drink with Tequila and Cointreau.It took me about 10 days the length of my stay at the Hotel to finally be able to put a Margarita together US style because they do not have the Mix like Jose Cuervo used in the U.S. So if anyone would like to taste at the Caravelle Bar pls. ask Davin or Stephan to prepare for you a Margarita"" Edgar"" style : long drink with Tequila | Cointreau | Grand Marinier and Amaretto di Saronno.Will definitely back next year",Mougins| France,17-11-12,No,5
Trou aux Biches,We stayed at TAB for a week as a big '0' birthday celebration for my husband - they provided a complimentary cake for him| which was really nice. The hotel grounds and pools are beautiful and the accommodation is comfortable and spacious (massive bed!). The restaurants all serve really good food but our favourite was the Indian - the staff in there couldn't do enough for us and the food was absolutely delicious. The one thing that I think they could improve on is to offer complimentary water in the rooms - in a 5*| one would surely expect water to be included. The staff were all very courteous and helpful| especially Sophie who initially greeted us and looked after us during our stay.Overall| I would recommend the TAB for a relaxing week in the sun.,Kent UK,13-11-12,No,4
Beautiful beach and good food,This is a very nice hotel with well trained staff. They have a long| beautiful beach and a few restaurants with really good food. We had a cottage with the sea view and a small pool| but if you want to enjoy the view you need to demand for the cushy sunbed mattresses which are currently only used at the beach| but not on your private balcony. What you get are the plastic loungers| so uncomfortable to rest on. Very odd but we are told the hotel is changing this policy.They also have tennis courts but you need to buy your own balls.The spa suffers from the common problem of poor massage technique. We tried several therapists but their massage is more ceremonial rubbing than what you might expect if you call for deeper and stronger massage. Apart from the male therapist with artsy beard| I forget his name| all others are lucky to have jobs at that hotel. Especially the hair stylist. If you are getting married here and are fussy about hair and make up| you better do your research and find proper stylists as they commonly resort to curling irons and tight buns.,Accra,12-11-12,No,4
Perfect Honeymoon!,I can not say enough good things about this resort...from the restaurants| to the room| to the staff! The pictures on the hotel's website are exactly the paradise you will arrive to. All of the staff remembered us by name and were so pleasant...even so to give us our favorite papaya vanilla jelly to take home! The food was unbelievable...from buffet breakfast to lunch to dinner by piano music. A few staff members that stick out in our mind...Fatima| the hotel manager| went out of her way to say hello to us by name and take time out of her day to talk to us. Jerome and Vishnu...restaurant managers who were so friendly and even concocted a special Mauritian tanning lotion for us! Devon and Sanjeev...bartenders at La Caravelle...who became great friends and we will never forget! We felt like we knew them forever and wish to visit Trou Aux Biches just to spend time with 'our friends' there. Thanks to all who made our honeymoon perfect...from the United States to Mauritius...the 20 hour flight was well worth every minute we soaked up in the sand to our conversations with the Mauritians! The hotel was in the best location...10 days of sun and no rain!,Morristown| New Jersey,08-11-12,No,5
Top Class Hotel - but something lacking,"This was our first time in Mauritius and our overall experience could be summed up as 'pleasing'.We had a family (two room) downstairs villa set back from the beach| but in close reach to one of the fantastic swimming pools. The villa was spacious and very modern. Housekeeping ensured that cleanliness was always maintained and they always were very friendly.The beach is well renowned for being clean| safe and well maintained and didn't let us down. Sand was soft & white and there was an army of people 'combing' the sand at night ready for its use by guests the very next day. Hawkers (like other reviewers will testify)| are such a nuisance. You are left with the feeling that the security who patrol the beach must get some kind of financial kick-back as they never seem to intervene. Top Tip: If you really don't want to get bothered| I came up with this idea: Just write out a sign in bold ""Ne me dérange pas!""| leave it on the side beach table next to you - and you'll be left in peace.We mainly found ourselves situated around the communal villa pool. This has the opposite problem - if you want any kind of service| you won't get anything around the pools. We found this to be strange as the margin this hotel makes on drinks can be classed by some to be astronomical| whilst others would class it as obscene. 4 glasses of coke cost me £20!Be under no illusion - this is not because Mauritius is expensive - it's the hotel who has a captive audience.Any 5* hotel must pride itself on good food and good service. Trou aux Biches is in this category.The problem is that| once the mask slips for one moment| there is no other place to go than downwards| which equals customer dissatisfaction regardless of how trivial the issue is.In the main| service was impeccable| staff were attentive and friendly| food was of good standard.L'Oasis bar however| must be run by another consortium! Trying to get the attention of any waiter for a drink is near impossible| made more of a mystery since there seems to be so many of them - perhaps it's because they are more intrigued in each other's conversations which leads to them forgetting why they are there.There are no signs suggesting what cocktails are on offer| or what the 'special' of the day is.Indeed| you are hard pressed to see any bar menus. (In general| there's a lot of guess work at this hotel. You have to do a lot of guess work from the food that is on offer through to times of meals| and 'where DO those kids get those scooters from?').Once you have the attention of a waiter| his main mission in life is to ensure that you are shown the bar menu in as little time as is possible| before whisking it away from you - obviously| as your only reason for attending the bar is to steal the menu!One reviewer summed up the hotel as 'stiff' and I think this is a true and accurate description.Don't get me wrong; some people/social groups do like formal/stiff.However| most hotels you go to have a central 'watering hole' where people meet| relax and enjoy the entertainment. We humans have simple needs and sometimes| want to be part of a wider| collective social group.The only place that this can happen is in L'Oasis bar. Given the lack of information on offer| disinterested bar staff and over-priced bar menu| most people walk straight on bye the bar and decide to turn in for the night - every night.Holidays shouldn't be like this....",Newbury| United Kingdom,03-11-12,No,4
Beautiful stay!,We stayed at Trou aux Biches in May this year for a friend's wedding and it couldn't have been more perfect for them. It was all beautifully planned with both ceremony and reception taking place on the beach| the surrounding scenery was stunning! With regards our stay at the hotel| I can only say that it was excellent. The selection of restaurants and variety and quality of food was outstanding (although bar prices very expensive). Service everywhere in the hotel was to a very high standard.The beach was lovely too and most watersports are free which is a bonus| as was the gym and some classes. The only negative I will say however| is that Trou aux Biches is in a rather isolated area of the island and there's not much in the way of Mauritian culture to be viewed here. The area is obviously catered more for tourists.,Gibraltar,30-10-12,No,5
Paradise with a Capital P,Five people in adjoining beach front villas with the surf only 30 yards form your plunge pool| idyllic sunsets| dive centre two minutes from your room| and unmatchable service then it makes a superb holiday!Quite one of the best holidays I have had.The hotel was fantastic.The service second to noneWonderfully arranged by Beachcomer in the UK.Best restaurant was Blue Ginger. They found out it was my daughters 20th birthday and made her feel extra special if not a little embarrassed with a cake . This was done without any prompting.The resort is very special but this is also supplemented by a quite superb island with lots to see and do. It really has something for all.,Southampton| United Kingdom,29-10-12,No,5
Fantastic| Amazing| Outstanding| Spectacular| Excellent| Beautiful!,We will apologise now for the long review however to cut it short would do it an injustice.We stayed at the resort in August 2012 and we were there for 2 weeks. We celebrated our wedding day mid-way through our stay. It was a holiday| wedding and it then made up part of our honeymoon before heading on to Dubai. We were at the resort with friends and family.My wife and I enjoy holidays and are fortunate enough to be able to stay in some of the best hotels around the world. We always depend on Trip Advisor as a good benchmarking tool prior to booking a hotel but to our embarrassment always come back from a holiday with every intention of writing a review but never get around to it! I guess this is a good place to start and the Trou Aux Biches deserves all the praise it can get. It is one of the best hotels we have ever had the pleasure of staying at. I think it’s fair to say our “vision” hasn’t been blurred by the fact it was our wedding and these were the sentiments also echoed by our friends and family that stayed at the resort. We have high standards| more so as it was our wedding. Anyone who finds fault in this hotel has serious issues. The biggest test of a good hotel is would you go back? Our answer and friends and families answer was a resounding YES!If you haven’t been to Mauritius| it’s a beautiful island and well worth a visit. We short listed the Island as a wedding destination and were very impressed with Beachcomber as a company. With that in mind and prior to taking our friends and family half way round the world| we thought it best to do a “site visit”. My brother and I headed out to Mauritius in March 2011 and spent a week on the Island visiting various hotels (It was tough!!). We arrived at a the Trou Aux Biches and whilst it was still in the final stages of completion (soft opening) we were blown away by the hotel| its location| beach and facilities and in general just how stunning it was. It was an easy decision and after one quick call to the other half we stopped looking and it was decided!We stayed in a beachfront junior pool suite for the duration of our stay. We decided on Villa 401 as it was well situated in the middle. These are beach facing villas with a large open area with their own splash pool . Friends and family stayed in a variety of rooms and all were lovely. Very well equipped| modern and immaculately clean. If you look at the hotel plan| you will see the hotel is situated on a 2km stretch of the most beautiful beach. One of the things that is most attractive about the hotel is how much space it has. The hotel has been there for the past 20 years so it is very well established but was demolished and rebuilt over a 3 year period re-opening in 2011. What this gives you is the best of both worlds| a very modern hotel with an amazing layout and facilities but grounds and gardens that reflect what you would expect from a tropical climate like Mauritius. The hotel has a main entrance that is stunning. The hotel is made up of 6 crescents. In our opinion crescents 5 and 6 were the nicest. Each crescent has its own pool and is a short walk to the beach. The hotel is very well laid out and everything is just a short walk. Walking around the resort is a pleasure as the grounds are so well kept. It really is picture perfect.I think it’s fair to say anyone can build a nice looking hotel and spend lots of money on it but without the staff it will not function. Whilst the hotel is amazing for me the key ingredient that makes the Trou Aux Biches so special is the staff. It’s a pleasure to stay in a resort where the people who work within it are local people who have knowledge of their island and are proud to be Mauritian! A lot of the staff members have been there since the original opening (20+ years). To them they are proud of their hotel and want it to succeed. This has a direct reflection on the highest and most friendly service levels we have ever experienced. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was sublime.There are a range of restaurants to choose from and the selection these restaurants has is nothing short of amazing. They have a buffet which is stunning| a sea food restaurant (The Deck)| a Thai restaurant| an Indian restaurant| Italian and La Caravelle which is their Al la carte signature French contemporary restaurant. The quality of food in any one of these restaurants is superb and the attention to detail and quality of produce is so high. Our favourite was La Caravelle. The food at this restaurant was nothing short of spectacular! The waiters and chefs were all so friendly| helpful and nothing was ever too much trouble. A big thank you to Randhir| Alan| Chef Paul and Chef Ashley along with all La Caravelle team for all your help in the lead up to the wedding and the day itself. Our guests have said that it was the best meal they have ever had! Also| a big thank you to Jerome and Fatima for your help and effort during our stay. We booked full board plus. In our opinion this was well worth it. They have a lovely selection of wines that cater for the various restaurants and menus. Great GYM facilities (Which you need after all the good food & wine!) and a lovely spa with great Steam and Sauna and excellent treatments on offer.This hotel is absolutely amazing. The facilities are wonderful| the restaurants are some of the best we've ever eaten at| the grounds are so beautiful| the beach is stunning and the atmosphere is sophisticated| sleek yet relaxed. The Trou aux Biches staff made our wedding/honeymoon so so special and it is certain to say that we will definitely be returning. Thank you TAB!We attached some pictures which show just how beautiful a place it is. This Hotel is well worth a visit!,London| United Kingdom,17-10-12,No,5
Heaven on Earth,I fell in love as soon as I went through the gates of the hotel. The greeting on arrival by Fatima was something special. There is not one negative I can find with Trou aux Biches! Absolutely perfect... The rooms are spacious| comfortable| luxurious and it's hard not to feel 100% relaxed as soon as you arrived. With a variety of themed restaurants| there is something for everyone food wise| and the quality is world class. The beach and swimming are amazing| and Trou aux Biches has one of the most spectacular sunsets I have ever seen. Every detail has been thought of| and every one of the 100 odd pools are inviting. The service is fantastic| and the hotel is peaceful and quiet. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Mauritius. This is my favourite hotel on the island...,Johannesburg| South Africa,16-10-12,No,5
Fantastic location| beautiful hotel,The hotel is set in an amazing location. The beach is fantastic and we were constantly told that it's one of the best beaches in Mauritius... and I believe that!!! We spent a week at the hotel for our honeymoon and although we enjoyed ourselves| we found the service to be lacking. The staff at Blue Ginger and Mahiya restaurants were really friendly and good. the service at Il Corallo was below par. La Caravelle was really good too. We spent a week at Shandrani prior to this and we found the staff there to be far more attentive and friendly. Sophie (from guest relations) was really friendly though and made us feel welcome by greeting us by name every time she saw us. The rooms are superb (we stayed in a junior tropical suite +). Drinks were generally very expensive - typical of hotels in Mauritius - so we settled for buying pre-dinner drinks from chez Popo (10min walk from the hotel) and they had a good selection of drinks at reasonable prices.The spa was excellent| the best I've ever been to.,Cape Town| South Africa,16-10-12,No,4
Slightly disappointed| but hard to say why.,We stayed for 12 nights in September 2012 (2 adults and 2 children 9 & 3). The hotel is beautiful and our family room was one of the nicest we have stayed in| the childrens room was far larger than the pictures imply. The bathroom off the main bedroom was fantasic. The beach was lovely and never felt crowded| although I should point out that during our stay the hotel was only about 60% full. Snorkelling from the beach was rubbish| very murky with few fish. For the first time ever in Mauritius the beach hawkers did not take no for an answer| the record was 9 polite 'no thank you's before being left in peace| whether this was due to the recession or just more determined hawkers| I'm not sure.The food on offer in the main buffet in the evening was very bland and confused. Every night there was cheese and tomatoe pizza and pasta with tomatoe sauce sitting next to chinese and indian food. Always very strange selections and combinations. The desserts were hidden away behind glass cases| they looked lovely but you usually had to ask to be served. The ice-creams and soberts were a mystery and never labelled| we could have ended up with banana| vanilla| coconut| etc. All of these things are small annoyances| but they shouldn't happen at a 5 star hotel. In the end we spent every night in one of the other restaurants| all of which were very good and we were able to book in the morning for the same evening. We stayed on the Full Board Plus package which was fine for us as we're not big drinkers| although we feel that the lack of an All Inclusive offer was the reason behind the bars that were empty in the evening.The main reason why we choose this hotel was that the childrens club took children from the age of 3| but it was always very quiet and some activities were cancelled due to small numbers. All of the staff seemed to be friendly and like children.This was the 4th hotel that we have visited in Mauritius and whilst good we preferred Sugar Beach and Lux Le Morne.,devon|,15-10-12,No,4
Perfect.,The look| the layout| and the many amenities available set the stage. The very friendly| skilled| and attentive staff carry it off beautifully. The reviews already listed are quite accurate. I would add just a little more: Fatima (manager) was delightfully helpful and went above and beyond. The gardens (which are everywhere) are absolutely gorgeous. The resort reopened about two years ago and the plantings are just coming into their own. I hope that a garden tour will be offered in the future. Jan (co-designer of the gardens) is a lovely and enthusiastic gal and the look of TAB is in good hands. The Indian restaurant is not to be missed. The chef was pleased that we loved his menu and came out to chat with us. The fitness center is wonderful! We're not gym fanatics but we tried to do a little bit each day. Everything is very personal at TAB. Lastly| we came from the US! We DO have the Caribbean and Bermuda so close by| but I wouldn't have missed this trip for the world! The vibe on Mauritius is incredibly relaxed compared to any other island nation we've visited. We seriously want to come back to Mauritius and to Trou aux Biches Resort. One BIG tip: Stop by the local grocer for mixers| snacks and lots of water. Come with your own alcohol for cocktails in your room. It'll help lower your bill for extras. Yes| water is not free!,Kailua-Kona| Hawaii,14-10-12,No,5

Thank you guys and Thank you Kevin!!! i will be back and look forward seeing you again!!! P.Gotseva,Dubai| Dubai| United Arab Emirates,24-09-12,No,5
Great hotel on a fantastic beach,We stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Upon arrival| we were offered cold lemongrass tea and then a nicely brief overview of the hotel and our package. We were then showed to our room (tropical junior suite +)| which was lovely. Large room with super kingsize double bed| massive bathroom with an outdoor shower. The suite was well-equipped| very clean and set in a lovely| quiet location. Our room was just set back from one of the satellite pools| which we used a lot (beautiful pool and v private and peaceful setting). The main pool is also very nice| but a bit noisier. The beach is fantastic - beautiful white sand and clear calm water. The hawkers on the beach were friendly and not aggressive| but still very annoying (despite saying no| some still persisted). We made use of some of the included watersports - snorkelling and kayak - and also one of the non-hotel inflatable rides| which was a great laugh. Also| my other half did his advanced diving course at the on-site dive centre and he thought they were friendly and professional.We were on the full board plus package| which included breakfast| lunch plus drink and water| and then dinner plus half a bottle of wine and water. We ate in all the restaurants which found then all to be very good. Breakfast was great in both restaurants and there were far too many options to choose from! There was also a good selection of lunch options as well| but had we eaten lunch there every day for the entire stay| we might have got a bit bored. Dinner at the Indian and Thai restaurants were very good. The Italian and International restaurants were also good| but there wasn't as large a choice of supplement-free options as I was expecting. Also| some of the supplement prices did seem a little inflated (ie. extra 1000 rupees for veal instead of steak| 1200 for prawns....). The buffet was fantastic - the quality and variety of the food was amazing - lots of yummy seafood! There was always too much that we wanted to try and everything we had was great. It was also really nice to have a cheeseboard (as I don't have a sweet tooth)| with a very good selection of French cheese.We opted for the house wine as this was included in our package - we tried most varieties and all were good quality. We didn't use the bar too often| but when we did| the prices were a little high| the entertainment wasn't to our taste and the atmosphere was a bit lacking. Usually we opted to have pre-dinner drinks on our terrace instead after stocking up at the local supermarket (Chez Popo on the main road has a good selection of stuff at good prices). Also| we got ice buckets from room service as the mini-bar doesn't really chill drinks - just keeps them cold if they are already cold.The service was generally very good and friendly. Though on a couple of occasions| a little over-attentive for our tastes (a waiter carrying my plate back from the buffet was a nice thought| but a little strange and definitely OTT for me!). There was only one member of the service staff that we thought was bad (surly waiter in the Italian). We used the Concierge on a few occasions to help us arrange things| but we think we were quoted inflated prices| simply because of where we are staying. We hired a car for a couple of days for £40/day (not extortionate| but the car was pretty rubbish!) - I think we might have got better value by booking online. We got a taxi to Pamplemousses and L'Aventure du Sucre which cost us 2100 rupees for a 4 hour outing| which seemed to be a lot more than our guide book suggested it should be. Furthermore| we got a taxi to 20 Degrees Sud for an excursion which cost us 500 rupees on the way there| but only 300 rupees on the way back.... Therefore| I think its probably a good idea to shop around a bit for car hire and taxis| as I don't think the hotel offers the best value choices. We also hired some bikes from the Causurina hotel (5 mins walk down the beach or road)| which I would recommend it as a way to see the local area. They cost us 500 rupees/day and we easily cycled to Cap Malheureux and back| with stops| in a day. Tip: We did the excursion to Flat Island via the 20 Degrees Sud Hotel and would definitely recommend it (it is open to non-guests| so just contact the hotel directly) and it was well worth the cost. The excursion involved a catamaran trip (with only approx. 15 or so other people)| breakfast| lunch| all refreshments| snorkelling| etc. After arriving in the lagoon between| Gabriel and Flat Island| we stopped for snorkelling for an hour| then we were transferred by a small boat to Flat Island. On Flat Island| there were bean bags on the beach where we chilled out and sunbathed| whilst the waiter brought us cold beers/wine. At lunchtime| we headed up to the ruins of the Governor's house for a two-course lunch and wine| which was lovely. Then we had a little bit more time to relax before returning to the catamaran for the trip home. The island is idyllic and the trip was the highlight of our holiday.Overall| we loved the hotel and the food and would definitely recommend it. If they introduced all-inclusive| then I think this place could be even better.,London,24-09-12,No,5
perfect honeymoon,Amazing hotel. We stayed in a beachfront villa with private pool for our honeymoon. The rooms are spacious and feel luxurious but also have basic essentials ie ironing board| wi- fi coffee machine etc. We didnt visit all of the restaurants but the indian and thai were both excellent. We also really enjoyed the buffet as it allowed us to eat healthier on a few days. The staff are really helpful/friendly without it feeling forced. We did a load of the free watersports during our stay and the staff on the beach were also easy going and patient. my only suggestion would be for the private pools to be heated as ours was always a bit cold. would definitely go again ,Nairobi| Kenya,23-09-12,No,5
Fantastic hotel. Trou aux Biches,Our thanks to the people of TAB who made our wedding a day and a vacation we will not forget. From start to finish| the service| friendly staff| accommodations| food| facilities and the facilitation for our adding we're impeccable. A special thanks to Winnie-Jane and Fatima for going out of their way for us. Will we be back? Does one need to ask...thanks again Brenda & Maurizio,Nairobi| Kenya,16-09-12,No,5
Brilliant vacation hotel,We thoroughly enjoyed two remarkable weeks at this hotel. The staff were magnificent and remembered our names| the food at the five restaurants was great| the room was spacious with an excellent shower both inside and outside. We preferred a suite facing north to get more sun during the winter. The only negative factor and a minor point was the price of wine - excessive. We definitely will return to enjoy the hotels excellent hospitality.,Knysna| South Africa,16-09-12,No,5
A fantastic hotel,First of all| let me warn you: DO NOT GET MISLED by low-ranking reviews| these are probably before a major renovation some two years back.So| on to the review: we were here on September '12 on our honeymoon. We had booked a beach front villa with pool| however pon our arrival we were bumped up to a senior beach front villa with pool| the hotel's best room available.Typically| beach front villas consist of two-story little 'huts'| with the regular one on the sand level and the senior one on top of the regular one| each with its own pool and direct access to the beach. The senior which accommodated us was simply put the best room we've ever been to| and we are very frequent travelers| having stayed at top hotels around the globe.The hotels 6 restaurants are all amazing with delicious food that matches every taste| from Italian to Thai. Water sports are free for guests| and the Clarins Spa is a delight. The hotel is very modern and luxurious| while the staff| in all our interactions was very friendy and courteous. Some issues with WiFi access were easy to get by with by the sheer enjoyment the hotel offered us. On the downside| if you're visiting this hotel| make sure you go for the beach front villas| because the garden-looking ones just take away some of the atmosphere Mauritius has to offer.Overall| a recommended choice| trust me| you'll love it|,Gordon's Bay| South Africa,11-09-12,No,5
Lovely hotel,The service was excellent|the staff remember your name as if by magic.We had a senior beach front pool suite that was spacious |clean and well furnished.The private pool was warm enough to swim in early September.Food at the speciality restaurants was of a hign quality|but we found the buffet at the main restaurant to be blan.This was not a problem as we had no problem making bookings at the other restaurants.Beach was much better than in the south of the island |soft sand and clear water.Usual gripe about wine prices in Mauritius.Overall an enjoyable holiday and we will be returning to Trou aux Biches on our next visit to Mauritius.Special thank you to Sophia who was always freindly helpfull.,Gordon's Bay| South Africa,11-09-12,No,5
Paradise!,Me and my partner visited this report in October 2011| so a little late getting this on her. upon arrival it was a fairly chilly day and night and having just came from Dubai this was a bit upsetting. However the next day and for the remainder of our stay the weather was amazingly hot and i would not hesitate to visit again in October again. We went before the half term period but as we were leaving the resort was getting pretty busy| which gave a bit more of an atmosphere. Staying in a beachfront suite with plunge pool| i must say this was an ideal choice for us and the other half likes to lie in| so i could easily soak up the sun on the deck or have a dip until he emerged! The room was amazing with all mod cons and spacious| with a lovely bathroom with inside and outside shower. The service on the beach was great but after a few strawberry daquiries realised our bill was clocking up...a lot. The beach is beautiful and so is the water. There are a few supermarkets a short stroll away from the hotel| to the left and then right| which sell alcohol of all brands and snacks very good priced| we filled up our room with drinks like this so we could enjoy a drink or two whilst on our patio area. The service in the hotel was first class and having just came from dubai we did not experience any difference in the service level we received here. The food and restaurants were very nice| but our favourite was the indian restaurant.The guys who work there are very friendly and there was a guy playing an instrument on the floor| in which he didnt mind me taking his sticks off him and sitting with him to learn.Whilst in Mauritius we went on a few trips| booked again outside the hotel from a lady in a small shop. We went on a catamaran trip which started from grand baie where we saw whales| went out to a secluded beach and had some amazing food aboard the boat| we were entertained by singing and music also. We also did paragliding from the guys on the jetty| that was a nice experience also and well worth the money| from what i remember not to expensive eitherI would definately go back to this resort,west mids,07-09-12,No,5
There's no 6 out of 5 so I chose 5 out of 5 :-) Amazing...,We stayed at Troux aux Biches in July and it was amazing. We had a 3-bed Villa (Number 700) which was huge...private pool and garden with Lounge Area inside and outstide| Big bedrooms| huge bathrooms| rain showers inside and outside. It's a big Resort but all the different Rooms and Villas seem secluded and nothing seemed too busy. Grounds are excellent| with tons of exotic stuff growing everywhere and pools dotted around the Resort - check out the Banyan Tree! Private Beach is awesome - long stretch of beautiful white sand and crystal clear sea. There are lots of different restaurants| food is excellent and the staff can't do enough to help you! Troux aux Biches is absolute paradise and I'll definitely be going back...,Manchester| United Kingdom,26-08-12,No,5
New | but service lacking,Trou aux Biche is one of the best beaches in Mauritius. But don't try to get a beer on the beach or beach towels at this 5Star plus Resort. There are a number of restuarants| but all fairly indifferent - with a feel of being part of one resort with indifferent service. Rooms are newly refurbished and attractive. My son tried to use the kids centre which is well equipped - but the person managing the facility arrived late (after a hard night of partying he told my 12 year old) and left early - locking up the facility for the rest of our three day stay.Very disappointing for my son as you can imagine.The spa was unmemorable.,Mauritius,12-08-12,No,3
If what you want is to relax with some beach activity| this is perfect,I was travelling for business and managed to squeeze in the weekend at this resort before flying back. The rooms are great| the beach is absolutely fantastic albeit no waves =( Everything was perfect| there are a few restaurants so you have a good choice of what to eat| etc. There are lots of activities that you can do at the beach| most of them free of charge if you are staying at the hotel. I would only say that if you dont like walking too much| make sure you mention this at booking| because some of the rooms are a good 10-15minute walk from the main area of the hotel where you find the restaurants and activities. Still| if you like the outdoors| this is lovely. Also| very important| I asked the employees of the hotel in one-on-one situations if the hotel is good to its employees| and they all had beaming smiles and said they are one of the best employers in hotels in Mauritius who take care of their people. Good to know!,London,02-08-12,Yes,5
Paradise| the best holiday I've ever had,Wow is all I can say| what an experience!We moved from another hotel in Mauritius because we weren't happy and all I can say is that it was money extremely well spent (we changed from a 4 star to Trou Biches). The natural setting is unbeatable: crystal clear turquoise waters| soft white sand and loads of space for guests (you never felt crowded or had to wait to use the paddle boats etc).The staff were incredible| nothing was too much trouble! They even arranged a special table for my birthday and a cake| it made the day so much more memorable! The room we had was a tropical suite and it was just perfect: great bathroom with an outdoor shower| a huge luxurious bed and a stunning verandah with a lounger for relaxing on.The gym/fitness centre was excellent: brand new equipment and very helpful staff. There was loads to do if you wanted a break from relaxing on the beach and all of the facilities were in tip top condition.And the food? It was quite simply magnificent! I've never eaten that well anywhere and it was consistently amazing. The buffet changed every day so you always had something different to try and there were 5 or 6 other restaurants so you never got bored - every night we had dinner was an incredible experience (Indian| Thai| Seafood etc) and we were blown away.We didn't take our toddler with us but we went and had a look at the kiddies centre and it looks like a child's idea of heaven! I'm already planning our next trip there| as it is my idea of paradise and one of the few places you can go to where you can completely relax. If you're looking for a holiday that is a bit of a treat| where you can relax and enjoy superb food| stunning surroundings and world-class service - then this is the place for you.,Johannesburg| South Africa,31-07-12,Yes,5
Luxury stay but...,"The hotel is a stunning property just south of Gran Baai with great restuarant and facilities. I have stayed in thre hotels in Mauritius that were lower star rates hotels that this one but I found that this hotel was alot more ""stiff"". The other hotel had a more welcoming atmosfere. If you like all the finer things in life| this is the hotel for you but dont expect a local flavour during your stay.",Western Cape| South Africa,18-07-12,Yes,4
Holidays & Conferences,Last visited this resort 34years ago| and WOW| what a change. The beach is in my opinion|the best on the island| with plenty of watersports available. The resort is enormous| however| there are buggies for ferrying guests to/from their rooms| available. The accommodation is beautiful| comfortable and spacious| with enormous bathrooms. Gardens are extensive and well laid out with the rooms/villas in 6 sections| each section with a pool. Nice selection of restaurants|(Thai| Indian| Italian| Buffet| Fine Dining) with really great service levels. Highly recommended holiday destination. Excellent conference facilities.,Johannesburg| South Africa,12-07-12,Yes,5
Spacious| modern| great value,"Before I start the review I want to point out that we originally booked to stay at Trou Aux Biches Resort for our entire 10 day stay in Mauritius however the hotel advised us prior to our arrival that there was going to be a large indian wedding of over 200 guests staying during our stay and offered us to transfer to another hotel for all or part of our trip| we elected to stay 4 nights here and 5 nights at the another Beachcomber hotel (Royal Palm) (see its review also!)This communication was excellent| I guess the hotel was under no obligation to tell us this and we could have had to put up with it| but it would have most likely spoilt the rest of our holiday so well done to this resort for allowing us to change (at no additional cost either!).Now onto the review.Arrival: We arrived late at night (after 8pm) by our own private transport| be advised that Trou Aux Biches Resort is NOT well sign posted from the road and we ""stumbled"" across it by pure luck really and asked the security if we were at the right place!| there is no signage or anything to tell you where it is. (take note if you drove yourself like we did).At checkin we were warmly welcomed| the checkin process was fast| almost a little fast| we were not informed about anything about the hotel| were not shown around the hotel| we were simply whisked away to our room by golf buggy| we ended up having to ask the driver where we had to go to eat| and what was included with our package.Rooms: Bear in mind this is a HUGE resort| with over 300 rooms| our room was quite a distance from the reception and main area| however there are 2 restaurants at our end of the resort aswell. Our room (Junior Suite) was spacious| very clean| tidy and well presented and comfortable| we were very pleased| no faults here!Resort: Huge!| Despite its size it is immaculately clean and very well looked after| a credit to the gardners and grounds staff. Because of its size initially we found it difficult to navigate around| but the map provided in your room key leaflet was invaluable and didnt take long to figure things out. The beach was great| well maintained and we always had access to sun loungers. The hawkers are annoying| we joked it would have been useful to have a prerecorded tape playing ""no thankyou"" every couple of minutes| however they do not bother you again once you decline.A disappointing mention we have to make is regarding the tennis| to this day I still cannot understand why this resort offers tennis courts and racquets complimentary| however you MUST purchase your own balls (500 MUR!!) to be able to play!| beyond me and we felt this was quite ridiculous| surely it is not hard to have a bucket of balls available to play with| if really needed charge people if they dont return them instead!.Food: Amazing!!. I was skeptical before going about the halfboard option| I had researched it and weighed up pros and cons etc but I'm glad we ended up going with the half board. The food was simply spectacular| different selections at each restaurant each night| a set menu with options included in your half board and also other options with an additional cost| we enjoyed the meals and variety. Breakfast was buffet style| great selection| we never left hungry at any stage.The half board does not include drinks at dinner| we read a lot of reviews commenting about the expensive food and drinks in Mauritius hotels| however overall we found the hotel prices for drinks and food to be comparable to what you would pay at any Perth restaurant/bar ($9 pint / $14-15 cocktail) so it didnt seem that over the top to us. The only exception is the wine| which is very expensive | (minimum $10+ per glass)Tip: We bought duty free spirits and drove a short distance to a supermarket and bought mixers and other nibbles much cheaper than at the hotel.Overall we were very pleased with our stay| and really enjoyed it| we found it value for money and the food was excellent| we would definately return.In saying that we had the privelage of staying at another Beachcomber hotel (Royal Palm) at no extra cost (a higher rate hotel) - check out our review of that also!",Serpentine| Australia,11-07-12,Yes,4
Beautiful!,well laid out hotel...love the bathrooms with the open to sky shower...spacious open feel...wooden floor. Large rooms too....and set in small villas which is basically a congregation of 4 or 5 types of rooms... swimming pool in every section..nice restaurants with extraordinarily friendly service...large option of water sports. Very thai in its architecture at the Lobby| and in the rooms. Gives the impression of ultra luxury but isnt really beyond an ordinary 5 star. Worth a visit! if you do go| dont miss a meal at the Deck restaurant..! On hindsight| I think it is over rated...if not for the extraordinary staff!,Mumbai India,06-07-12,Yes,5
Paradise,We got married at Trou Aux Biches in March. Mauritius is paradise and Trou aux Biches is by far the best hotel in the north of the island. Expensive but worth it. Excellent facilities| particularly loved the outside shower! Lots of water sports (diving| snorkelling| paddle boats|etc). The beach was beautiful and cleaned every morning.The spa was amazing - we got plenty of use out of it! :-)We were so well looked after during our stay| I've never been so spoilt. Staff were really friendly. I even put on almost a stone in two weeks because we ate so much! Lots of choice in the 5 restaurants.Highly recommend this hotel to anyone.My money saving tip is to make a trip to the supermarket when you first arrive. Food/wine in the hotel is very expensive but you can buy the same stuff for a fraction of the price. It is walking distance but taxis are very cheap - especially if you want to stock up on rum / wine. :-),Reading| United Kingdom,02-07-12,Yes,5
We will be back!!,We have just returned from a 10 days (9-19th June 2012) at Trou aux Biches Resort & Spa with our son who is 4 and a half and highly recommend it as a wonderful family holiday destination. I always use Tripadvisor when planning holidays| found the reviews of others to be of great value and I can confirm the many positives they expressed and which we experienced.It was our first visit to Mauritius (in fact| our first island holiday) and it most certainly will not be our last. The country is a cosmopolitan mix of cultures and friendly people who lead a very peaceful but organised existence.WeatherIt is Winter in Mauritius which was perfect for us as we prefer moderate temperatures (mid 20s during the day) and reasonable humidity levels. Although it rained on some evenings and the wind blew on a few days| this in no way affected our daily activities. The sand is soft and so does not sting when the wind blows and clouds clear rapidly after any rain so it was never even remotely cold.Forex Our advice would be to take your home currency and exchange it all at the airport as there was about a 5% difference between that rate (3.39 rupees to the rand) and the hotel (3.23 rupees to the rand).The HotelNewly renovated and cleverly designed with a village feel| we loved everything about it| from the beautiful gardens to the minimalist décor. It was far from full as we went out of school holiday season but there were many honeymoon couples and quite a few families with children from all parts of the globe. Although it is a large resort| at no time did we feel a lack of privacy or crowded in| as there are more than ample loungers both on the beach and at the various pools and none of the units overlook any others.Our accommodationWe had a Senior Beachfront Suite which was a delight (they have a wonderful 60th birthday special on until 31 July) with stairs leading straight down to the garden and beach about 50 meters away. Charles had his bed in the lounge so we had our privacy| the swinging couch on the patio became my favourite reading spot and the pool was great for Charles when we had had enough of the beach for the day. The bathroom was wonderfully OTT with a huge bath and 2 fabulous indoor and outdoor showers. The safe was also large enough to store my medium sized laptop and wifi in our room was free so we were able to Skype the grandparents back home. Our bed was huge and very comfortable and our pillows were real down which is one of my hotel benchmarking criteria!!The serviceAll the staff were friendly| efficient and full of smiles. They all knew Charles by name and were as attentive as possible to our every need. They have a customer relationship manager| Elise| who seems to make an effort to see all the guests in turn a few times during the hotel stay as does one of the general managers. Full board plusWe chose this option at an extra R1038 per day (R519 per adult as we were not charged for Charles) and it was well worth it. It equated to around an extra 3500 rupees per day but it would have cost us much more had we not gone this route as we did not eat breakfast late and were hungry by lunchtime after all the morning activities and swimming. We easily stayed within the plan the entire holiday as there are ample choices on every restaurant menu to avoid being charged supplements without feeling deprived.It allowed us (including Charles) a choice of 2 courses at lunch with a glass of wine| beer or juice per person and a bottle of water for the table. We received a bottle of wine and bottle of water per couple at dinner and a juice for Charles. We drank white wine and the perfectly pleasing option offered was Kleine Zalze Sauvignon Blanc which costs R47 per bottle at the estate here in South Africa!! But the hotel cost for wine and very delicious freshly squeezed pineapple juice is 280 rupees (+- R85) per glass| water around 130 rupees (R40) per bottle. The cheapest bottle of wine in the minibar was 1400 rupees (R425).Bob Marlin Kids ClubThe kids club is wonderful| equipped with its own sandpit| shallow pool| Apple computer| big screen tv| kitchen and lots of toys and games and books. But it is the daily programme and the staff which make it stand out amongst hotel kiddy clubs. Jonathan| Joanie| Elsa and the rest of the team were enthusiastic and organised. The children were taken to learn how to ski| for glass bottom boat trips| tennis lessons| beach explorations and swimming outings. The also had all sorts of quality crafting options like t-shirt painting| bracelet making| canvas painting to name but a few. Charles is fairly shy and took a few days to settle in and make friends so only went sporadically at first but once he felt comfortable| he did not want to leave!! Once he agreed to go to dinner at the Oasis restaurant with the other kids in the evenings| we had the chance to try the Thai & Indian restaurants.RetaurantsOverall| at all the restaurants| the food| both in taste and presentation| was really good. The children’s menu options were also reasonable with enough healthy options to choose from.Oasis – the main buffet option open for breakfast and dinnerAlthough we are not fond of buffets and only ate dinner here twice (being the day we arrived and on the Mauritian Themed evening)| we were impressed with the quality and selection on offer. Oysters| sea urchins| the most delicious grilled chicken and a myriad of bite sized dessert options stand out in my mind. We had breakfast here most mornings finding it difficult to choose between all the choices on offer. Lots of fresh fruit| continental and many cooked options to suit all tastes and cultures. Charles| of course| thought the pancakes were the best!!La Caravelle (international)– open for breakfast| lunch & dinnerBreakfast is a smaller version of what is on offer at Oasis but the setting is lovely| with waterfalls and pools surrounding the restaurant.We only had dinner here once as the choices are much the same as at lunchtime and we found this to be the least exciting menu apart from the desserts (fantastic chocolate fondant). The children come here with the Kids Club for lunch.Il Corallo (Italian) – open for dinnerOverall| the menu is not large but their antipasti selection is spectacular and they have couches at some tables which allowed Charles to go to sleep in comfort when he was ready. At the other restaurants 2 chairs were just pushed together to make a bed which was also perfectly fine.Le Deck (Seafood) – open for lunch & dinnerOur favourite restaurant| not only for the spectacular position directly overlooking the beach and the delicious food (mainly seafood but they also do a really good rib-eye steak)| but because of the truly lovely staff. Pratheema| Jay and their team were just superb particularly with Charles whom they went out of their way to charm and treat (he even got to meet the chef in the kitchen!!).Blue Ginger (Thai) and Mahiya (Indian) – no children under 12 – open for dinnerThey offer a Chef’s tasting Menu which changes every 3 days. We had dinner at each of these restaurants twice and thoroughly enjoyed the 4 different menus we experienced.EntertainmentAs we are not night owls and have a little one who needs to be in his bed at a reasonable hour| we did not stay around for the nightly entertainment on offer at the Oasis Bar.But the evening entertainment at the La Caravelle Bar which sits between La Caravelle and Il Corallo was superb. Live piano and/or Jazz Trio with really good vocalists. Water We drank the tap water every day in our suite and suffered no ill effects and feel that there is no need to pay 110 rupees (R33) a litre from the mini bar.Beach VendorsWe chose to support them as they really do add local colour to the beach experience and were in no way bothersome. If you say “no thanks” they happily move on. But those we chose to buy from were really interesting to talk to and all said they find South African tourists the most engaging in terms of conversation. My husband| who loves bargaining| had great fun playing the “how much?” game once we had chosen what we wanted to buy.Tourist attractionsAs we were there primarily to relax and did not want to spend days shopping or joining the tourist conveyor belt| we chose to hire a car with a driver for a day (about R1500) and devised our own itinerary which included everything we were interested in visiting and thought would also be enjoyed by Charles as opposed to doing the “canned” tourist excursions. We met a South African gentleman at OR Tambo| Michael Cochlin| who had lived in Mauritius for 2 years and he recommended a taxi driver in Grand Baie called Rajiv +230 4997514 – said just to mention that Michael had given us his number. I| stupidly| stored this information so securely that I only found it again when we arrived home but we will definitely call him on our next trip.Do not request that lunch be included as your driver will be able to recommend and take you to a local restaurant for a far more authentic experience. We had a really delicious lunch at a small unassuming restaurant close to the Tea Estate where the cost of the entire meal of decent sized lobster with various sauces| catch of the day and grilled chicken and chips for Charles as well as 3 pineapple juices was 2900 rupees (R880) which was less than the hotel supplement of 3100 rupees (R940) for a lobster meal for one person.The Glass Factory is owned by Coca Cola and uses recycled glass to do the glasswork. It was interesting to watch the people at work and their products are not expensive although their range was disappointing. They do| however| sell the cheapest water and drinks on the Island @ 22 rupees (R7) per bottle (Coke| Fanta etc) as opposed to 28 rupees (R8.50) in the supermarkets and 130 rupees (R40) from the hotel mini bar.The Tea Estate experience was very informative. Even though it is not currently picking season and we were the only visitors| the manager took us through the factory and showed us the entire process. We also did a tasting of all the flavours on offer – Lemongrass and Ginger being our favourite. The tea was also not expensive to purchase.The Model Ship Factory was rather disappointing as it felt like we were on a tourist conveyor belt with the emphasis being on sales and not enough of the actual building process on view. But they do have something for everyone as far as products go – jewellery| model motorbikes| speed boats and racing cars as well as beautifully crafted world globes (very expensive at around R3500)Curepipe has the volcano crater which is not hugely impressive but the view over the city to the mountains in the distance is worth the trip. And Charles truly enjoyed his 99 rupee (R30) softserve!!Cacharel has a double waterfall and the 7 coloured volcanic earths on display as well as some giant tortoises. It was rather a disappointment and| in retrospect we should rather have used the time to visit elsewhere elseBut what we missed this trip| we will see next time.In conclusion| it was one our best family holidays to date and we plan to return as soon as the opportunity arises.,Johannesburg| South Africa,01-07-12,No,5
We saw two sides to this hotel,We loved the beautiful rooms| stunning surroundings with kind and attentive service from the customer facing staff. The food in the main buffet and the Deck restaurant was outstanding and the waiters first class. On the other hand we were exasperated by the inefficiency of many of the management processes.We were staying at the hotel as part of a wedding party. There were around 25 of us including my niece and her bridegroom. We had agreed with the very helpful Beachcomber staff member in London that my 83 year old mother would have a room close to the main block of the hotel. When we arrived we found we were in rooms by the Spa – right at the back of this large resort. No way could my mother walk the distance – a good 7 min for me – more like 15 min for her. Reception staff were very| very kind but said they could not help. They did not have any record of our special request about my mother’s room. And the hotel was very full. I was firm and insisted that they needed to sort out a different room. After an hour or two they did so.The entire wedding party met for dinner in the Italian restaurant that first night. They could not cope with our large(ish) group. The meal was a shambles – e.g. lukewarm food| slow service and not enough menus to go round. To cap it all they tried to charge us for the wine we had eventually been told was all in as part of our Full Board Plus package. It became apparent over the next few days that the staff did not understand the Full Board Plus Package. They did their best and were politeness itself. Even the managers we saw had no authority to solve any minor problems with the package. Each time we asked for the bill to be corrected| managers were running round in small circles.The day before the wedding the hotel disabled all our door keys – the system was telling them that we were all leaving that day!! Clearly no-one understood how to manage the bookings computer. These petty irritations were mounting up – they should never happen in a five star hotel.Thankfully the wedding day itself was well managed. The wedding planner was helpful and efficient. The ceremony on the beach was wonderful| followed by a private BBQ dinner in one of the Executive villas.To sum up. Senior managers need to take a long hard look at the way the hotel is run. The lack of flexibility| inadequate management processes and systems undermine the hard work of the staff.Talking to my husband| we came to the conclusion that if we had been at the hotel on a simple Full Board Package| we would have had an excellent holiday. This is a lovely hotel| with a great beach and willing and loyal staff. I hope the management get their act together.Tip on getting the best from the hawkers on the beach: Once you talk to a hawker you are seen as their ‘client’. All the other licensed hawkers will steer clear so you don’t get a chance to compare what is on offer. Watch the goods being displayed to other guests. Then decide who you want to talk to and bargain with. I bought some lovely pearls from the man who calls himself ‘King of Pearls’ and some very good value pashminas from ‘Columbo’.,Buckinghamshire| England,20-06-12,No,4
A dream,We stayed here after staying in an apartment with four friends and a pretty full schedule of activities. From the moment we arrived | we forgot about it all and just knew we would be pampered for the next five days. And true in form| we were. Clean| modern and exceptionally well looked after from customer service to room tidiness. This place is perfection. Take avail of the free water-activities| long stretches of white sandy beach| spa treatments and the waterfall shower in the rooms (my favorite!). It was my little bit of heaven after coming from the sun. Our favorite place to dine by far on the resort -- Mahiya. Indian food of the best quality and a dining experience like we've never had. TOB was our little sanctuary at the end of a long trip. Highly recommend. Also| make sure to check on official website for deals and offers. Anywhere from 10-40% off booking is fabulous in anyone's books . We went for the half board and were very happy we did.

Beautiful beach resort| very well done !,A relatively new and upmarket beach resort in the north west of the island.Rooms are spread out over a grassy area near the beach in small clusters of buildings| usually around a central pool.My room was very modern| very stylish and wel equipped| the bathroom was probably the biggest and best equiped i have ever seen| the rain shower was awesome !The place is right on the beach| which is not particularly big| but sandy and clean.The whole place has a far east feel to it and 3 restaurants to chose from| thai| indian and international| all of which are around a central water feature and excellent| plus an italian restaurant at the other end of the development and a lovely outdoor bar area.Most people staying here are either couples/honeymooners or with young kids| but this is a very peaceful place to get away from everything.Within 10 minutes drive of the hotel there are many restaurants and a few shops| so lots of variety to choose from.The airport is about a 45 minute drive typically| with just a couple of spots where you might hit traffic| but mostly its an easy drive.Highly recommended,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,28-05-12,No,5
Lovely stay at newly built trou aux biches,I stayed here for three nights with my wife for a conference| we were in a base category room which was on the first floor and very spacious| the view was of the gardens.Higher category rooms are beach facing but have less privacy as look onto the walkway along the beach. The beach is running but can be narrow| we ate at the Indian restaurant which was very good and also the main buffet restaurant where food quality was excellent and choice varied.I enjoyed the water sports and did waterskiing| wake boarding and snorkelling all of which were included.I would definitely return to the hotel and recommend to others.,London| United Kingdom,27-05-12,No,5
One of my favorites ever,Friendly people| great food| terrific service| magnificient room| and a beautiful setting. This was an amazing place. I just wish it wasn't so darn far!Had a room on the beach with an outdoor shower| a private spa| and a walkout patio to the beach. Breathtaking!About an hour and a half from the airport| but worth the extra drive. Did a rum tour while we were there| which was a whole lot of tour and only a little rum| but a great way to see the wonders of this beautiful island.,Katy| Texas,26-05-12,No,5

AMAZING,Oh my ...words fail me.this is a piece of heaven|total paradise.You won't be disappointed.7star luxury| huge suite|private pool and absolutely delicious food located on one of the islands most beautiful beaches.Can't wait to return !,Canterbury| United Kingdom,20-05-12,No,5
We absolutely loved it,We stayed here last year just before the refurb was finished and had a brilliant time. staff were great| nothing was too much trouble| and the quality of the pod was excellent| we especially liked the Italian restaurant| antipasti selection was lovely.really unusual to have such a good selection of place to eat| and a Welcome change from buffet only hotels.Kids club great as was spa. Good selection of water sports. Lots of sunbeds on the lovely beach which was cleaned every day by the tractor man| our son's favourite person!Although the resort is big| it didn't feel it and the personal service we received was excellent. We would definitely retun.,Uk,29-04-12,No,5
Peaceful| Tropical Paradise,Recent reviews have been much more representative of the resort. I would say the review by Nicky F is very balanced and informative. I cannot add much more except from the perspective of guests without childrenMy absolute favourite part of the hotel were the magnificent gardens which attracted lots of bright birds so there was plenty for me to watch from my sunlounger. We also loved the fact that the peripheral pools near us were frequently empty. If the kids club came for swimming lessons it was simple enough to move up to the next pool for a bit more tranquility. The resort was so peaceful. So much so that if you were after extended nightlife then this is not the place for you. We were the only people up in the bar at midnight. However as we only has a week| long flights and very busy jobs we were happy to retireAlthough we love children we do not have any and so it was nice to dine at the themed restaurants ie Indian and Thai for a more peacful adult dinner tThe food was wonderful notably in the Indian we have a lot of really good curry restaurants in our area of London and have visited India and this really shone. The staff were lovely and really attentive so I am not sure about the prior reviews which stated poor serviceThe only negatives which did not diminish our trip. Price even though it is a five star luxury resort. We were half board. So for lunch on our first day we tried to economise and bought a hot| sweaty baguette to share| one packet of crisps and one coke from the hotels van which was vending in the beach area. It was nearly £20 ! and horrible too. I wish we had bought a panini from the restaurant same price much more civilised andit would have tasted much better. Take duty free for pre dinner drinks or visit one of the restaurants Le marmite Mauricien is nearish the gates and very friendlyStaff topping up our wine very fast and then tried to sell another bottle. I can understand why they are trained to do this but sometimes it was a little over the topAnyway overall it was a beautiful stylish peacful break and I think the hotel catered for families and those without children equally well,Singapore| Singapore,28-04-12,No,5
A first class family holiday!,Currently here lapping up the sunshine! A comfortable 29 degrees| mostly sunny with the occasional cloud added for decoration! Beautiful| comfortable| top class service resort. Lots to do for the whole family| a fantastic kids club that beats any we've seen yet! The kids enjoy day trips around the resort| even off the resort for sugar cane factory trips if you desire. Pedal boats| sail boats| glass bottom boats are free at will. Pay sports for speedboats and paragliding at a charge too. Waters are crystal. Sand is white powder. Pools are plentiful and not crowded. Accomodations are newly refurbished and very tastefully done. We stayed in the Tropical Suite Plus| 2 adults and 2 kids ages 2 and 4....more than enough room| extra cot free| fridge| bathroom that blows you away! Modern and everything needed. Restaurants are great| buffet with lots of choices| and 5 restaurants for Indian| Italian| Thai| French and an all purpose one open for lunch and snacks too! Glad we chose this resort on the North West Coast| waters are calm and clear. ABout an hour drive from the airport...doing 80kms/hour| going thru the capital city of Port Louis was slow| traffic at rush hour...allowed a nice view though| no bother. As for the negatives...a few too many beach peddlers selling jewlery and boat rides| but not rude and go away if your not interested...they do speak english well and can provide alot of information about the island and area though. No all-inclusive available| best you can do is the half board we were told| not bad| but no lunch| unless you pay and alcohol and soft drinks are quite pricey! Coffee is 400 Rupees...thats about 15 USD or 9 GBP thereabouts. Stores outside the resort sell cheaper drinks and snacks for the room| 10 minute walk| safely. Staff extremely helpful| management very intune with 1st class service. Very pampered here. Like I said| currently enjoying it immensely| chilled out at the pool| in the shade....time for a dip! Ciao!,Brampton| Canada,24-04-12,No,5
An amazing family holiday!,We have just returned from a 10 night stay at Trou aux Biches with our 3 children (3| 5 and 7). Before we left I had read some of the recent reviews on Trip Advisor and was a bit concerned| in fact we nearly changed hotel. Thank goodness we didn't! The hotel is fantastic! We had a Family Suite which was perfect - it's modern in decor with plenty of room and very comfortable. We thoguht the layout worked great| and far better than interconnecting rooms which most hotels offer. The main pool is fantastic with a lovely shallow area for little ones but there are also 5 other pools which are located throughout the resort. We loved the one nearest our room which was usually empty and very peaceful. The beach is wonderful| there are plenty of sun beds but we never felt too near other people. There are a few hawkers on the beach but they are so friendly and didn't bother us at all and actually added to the atmosphere. The staff at the Boat House are great| we went snorkelling which was breathtaking| did some sailing and canoeing and the children water-skied with the Kids Club. The sunsets in the evening are also gorgeous. The food was fantastic. We did the Full Board Plus deal| which I would really recommend. With all the swimming and outdoor activity| the children were starving by lunchtime and we were able to stay within the plan's limits the whole holiday. We had breakfast at La Caravalle everyday where the staff were amazing. It's not as big as the buffet at L'Oasis but the views out to sea are wonderful. We tried all the restaurants and had absolutely super meals and they were very accommodating with the children. The fish in particular was always amazing but my husband had some beef that he is still raving about. The buffet is good but by its nature and with 3 children it felt like we were up and down a lot. We had a super holiday and really couldn't fault the staff who were so friendly and helpful. They knew us by name and were great with the children. Nothing was too much bother and they always went out of their way to make sure we were having the best possible time. If you are looking for a smart| well- run| family friendly hotel with a super atmosphere and beautiful setting then go toTrou aux Biches. My only negative would be the Mosquitos but these were not in our room| just in the evening when we were eating outdoors. Just arm yourself with plenty of spray and you'll be fine.,London,23-04-12,No,5
we cannot wait to go back!,We have just returned from our Easter holiday at the Trou aux Biches resort . We travelled with three boys aged 2| 6 and 8 and we had a fantastic time!!! The boys spent time with us but they could not wait to go to the kids club. The little one| being less than 3 y| had a wonderful baby sitter booked through the kids club. My husband and I managed to have time for ourself on the beach and to go for dinner in one of the 5 restaurants| where the food is very impressive. The rooms are outstanding. The pools are too. We have been there few years ago| before the hotel renovation and I must say we were very impressed with the quality of the work. The staff are sometime a bit slow ( it fits with the place)| but always very helpful. So don't be afraid to ask!! No negatives...we all cannot wait to go back.Simona,uk,18-04-12,No,5
Great family holiday,"We (2 adults plus 3 children| aged 5| 7 and 8 yrs) have just returned from a wonderful 10 night stay at Trou aux Biches resort. To give context to what follows| other hotel/resort beach holidays we have been on (with or without children) include Zighy Bay in Oman| the Ritz Carlton and the O&O Royal Mirage in Dubai and the Four Seasons in Sharm. For an overall family experience| both we and the children would rate TAB top of that list and will certainly return (as a couple| Zighy Bay would be hard to beat). The detailed comments below are included (a) because there are very few post-relaunch reviews so far (and I am not sure that there is any point relying on pre-relaunch reviews) (b) our experience was universally positive in contrast to some of the previous reviews| so I hope some specifics may assist in forming a view. Resort - very recently| completely redesigned and everthing looks fantastic| in a much more natural| less showy/glitzy way than in Dubai. It is a big resort but when we were there it was no more than 50% full (and the intention is (apparently) never to get close to max occupancy) and we did not find the size a problem at all. Sure| the main restaurant (buffet) is necessarily very big| but there was no shortage of tables at it or anywhere else; no shortage of beds around the pool or on the beach (and no early morning reserving of beds); and the ""village"" layout (with no long corridors etc) meant that visually the resort felt| to us| relatively intimate rather than (as has been described in another review) like a cruise ship (which is my idea of hell). The only thing I would say is that if it rained properly and there was a wind| there might be an issue finding sufficient dry inside space in the restaurants (but if it's poring with rain that may be the least of your worries).Room - we had a family suite (2 rooms| 2 bathrooms and a lobby) which worked brilliantly for the 5 of us| was modern| stylish and very comfortable (though if you like big thick carpets and gold taps this is not for you) and| all things considered| very good value (at a little over £500/night for the 5 of us). Location - on the NW coast of Mauritius and therefore with the best weather at this time of year (more sun| less rain| little wind). Note that as far as I can tell weather forecasts from the UK for Mauritius are completely useless for an island that appears to have a series of very micro-climates: the only thing the forecasts got right was the days of the week. A bit over an hour's transfer from the airport (very dependent on Port Louis traffic). Beach - beautiful: long with fine| white sand and clear| clean blue/green water. As with all Mauritian beaches| it is not a private beach but there were few non-guests where we were and those that there were (including the few friendly hawkers) added colour and charm rather than nuisance (the hawkers are trying to make a living but once you say no| they leave you alone completely - my wife however| positively enjoyed looking at their wares and bought bangles| kaftans| pashminas etc for tiny sums!).Weather - it probably rained most days but only for a matter of minutes and made no difference to the holiday (despite us being sun lovers). It was always very warm; occasionally a bit humid; generally a few clouds passing by; but plenty of lovely| hot sun.Food - breakfast buffet at Oasis was very good indeed (except for juices) both for adults and kids; we had lunch at Le Deck| Caravelle and on the beach (Oasis was not open for lunch) and all were excellent (again| both for adults and kids) though| as one would expect| fairly expensive (less so for the kids); dinner was very good at the Italian and Caravelle (with the children)| excellent at the Indian (no kids allowed)| ok at the Thai (ditto) and variable (from excellent on Easter Sunday to ok on the other occasion we went there) at the Oasis buffet (though it was our children's favourite). Wine/drinks - sensible and reasonable selection of wines by the glass (white| pink and red) at around £6-7 a (smallish) glass and a well chosen selection of better wines| albeit at pretty remarkable mark-ups (though probably slightly better than in Dubai). Only issue was that several glasses of the different reds tasted badly stewed| a reflection| I am sure| not of the wine itself but of the conditions in which it had been stored. But they replaced it without fuss (though I am not sure they had any idea what we were talking about) from a better bottle. Local beer (Phoenix) on tap and excellent (around £5 for a 33cl glass). Soft drinks priced as you'd expect for somewhere like this| except fruit juices which were oddly expensive (as much as the wine).Full Board Plus - we didn't pay for this option (we were on half-board which allows you to eat at the buffet or have the table d'hote menu at any of the other restaurants for dinner) but If you are likely to want two proper courses at lunch in the resort everyday and to drink wine/beer with both lunch and dinner| the full board plus option would be worth doing (at least if they allow you to take lunch a la carte at either Caravelle or Le Deck rather than at the buffet at Oasis| as they did when we were there) particularly at the prices available from some companies in the UK (which is much lower than at the resort itself).Sports - great tennis set up (6 courts| both hard and artificial grass) with an excellent (if expensive) head tennis coach who gave the children lessons and hit with me; all water sports (including water skiing even for beginners) included with tuition as necessary and very well run.Kids Club - easily the best we have experienced both physically (well designed so that the club itself felt entirely open air but had plenty of covered areas) and in terms of programme; our children dipped in and out of the varied programme (which included an intro to water skiing)| made friends and enjoyed what they did; staff seemed very competent and friendly; children can have lunch (for around £9) at the club and dinner (included in half-board); however| if the meals are being served in the kids club itself| I (and my kids) would pass (the food was relatively poor)| whereas when the kids were being taken to Caravelle for lunch and Oasis for dinner it's a more attractive option Service - a lot of previous reviews have complained about the service and I was almost tempted to change resorts before we went as a result: the one thing I didn't want| having switched from the Middle East| where service is superb| to Mauritius was to be constantly irritated by the standards of service. I am very glad we stuck with it: the service may not be quite as slick as in the Middle East| but it was very| very good and delivered 99% of the time with a smile and charm. If it was slightly less sharp than in| say| Dubai that felt entirely in keeping with the more relaxed| genuine atmosphere of the resort: no one polished my sun glasses on the beach and I have lived to tell the tale. The resort manager| Fatima| was around a lot keeping an eye on things - she managed to speak to us (by name) almost every day to see that we were happy.Other guests - the resort seemed popular with both couples and families| though perhaps more of the latter than the former (and while that may in part reflect the time of year (school holiday)| I would say it was a resort particularly well suited for families); guests came from all around the world| with of course| lots of French (which is the first language of the local staff); there seemed to be fewer shouty / mobile phone / blackberry obsessives than in Dubai; most people seemed friendly but everyone left you as much space as you wanted.Negatives - nothing really.Overall - our experience is impossible to reconcile with some of the earlier reviews other| possibly| on the basis of timing: when the resort finally re-opened last year| I suspect it (unsurprisingly) took some time to settle down but| in our opinion| it has done so now. In short we loved it and will not be going back to the Middle East in a hurry.",london,17-04-12,No,5
Superbly renovated hotel,The hotel which has been re-opened recently after several months of renovation is a delight to the eyes: the small water basins| the large swimming pool| various gardens| the seaview and the stylish bed- and bath-rooms. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with the weather in our favour. Of all the hotels I have been to| this one had the best breakfast buffet at L'Oasis restaurant just in front of the pool with a large selection of food items. Dinner at La Caravelle was nice but not extraordinary| however I left the hotel with a very good impression about its food after lunching at Le Deck seafood restaurant| with your feet in the sand. Never have I eaten such tasty seafood burger| crabmeat croquettes and mussels spaghetti. Just perfect. The hotel staff is nice as well but only one negative remark about our stay: at times staff seemed so taken up by their work and were sometimes not smiling when you expected some warmth. Else| go for it.,Mauritius,06-04-12,No,4
Great stay in an amazing hotel!!!,Stayed at the recently refurbished Trou Aux Biches for 3 nights with my husband and family in March 2012. We had a wonderful time there - beautiful white sandy beaches| delicious food and the room was absolutely fantastic... I particularly enjoyed the massive bathroom + outside shower! The staff was very nice| helpful and especially very attentive to my little nieces (3 years old and 9 months' old). Breakfast and dinner buffets were top quality. Wide range of free water sport activities on offer. Will definitely go back. Highly recommended.,London| United Kingdom,04-04-12,No,5
Wow| what a magical resort...definitely one to be revisited!,Myself and my best friend stayed at this beautiful hotel. Wow| words cannot express my thanks and gratitude to all that made my experience so enjoyable! The experience at Troux aux biches was really beyond my expectations. Top class....service was impeccable throughout the resort. From the porters| to reception staff| to bar staff| waiters everywhere..just totally flawless...Everyone also so friendly and so humble. The rooms were lovely| spacious and very modern. The resort itself was beautiful...everything always so clean and smelling good. The culinary delights at all 6 restaurants were delicious...I've never tasted food this good before. The live entertainment at the various restaurants was also something I will not forget. The bands that played in the evening were also very entertaining as well as the saga dancing. The beach was beautiful too| definitely one of the best beaches in Mauritius! This place is so romantic. Definitely the ideal place to go for honeymoon or to celebrate a special occasion with your partner. The location of this stunning hotel was perfect too; it took us about 10mins drive to get into Grand Bay where we did all our shopping and catamaran cruise. Wow| I will definitely go back. I will see you again in the near future Troux aux biches. This is one resort that I will definitely refer to all my friends and family.....I had one phenomenal experience!,Cape Town,26-03-12,No,5
Perfect hotel for honeymoon!,My husband and I got married in this beautiful hotel last March. We stayed in Front Beach Villa with it's own swimming pool.Accommodation was fantastic. Very spacious with outside shower! Food was lovely and wine list was great as well. Our wedding Coordinator Ken made all wedding preparations stress free.I'd would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for quite secluded holidays.,Braidwood| United Kingdom,09-03-12,No,5
Third stay at this resort - its recent refurb makes you want to revisit,Located on the best side of the island for calm seas and swimming| The beach is cleaned every day and miles of long white sandy beach. Friendly hawkers on beach selling the beachware and jewellery| you are not pestered and they all carry licence badges. A bit of fun haggling. If you have the money opt for one of the seaview bungalows with own splash pool. All bungalows are in gardens. Six restaurants| but the best one by far was the International| smaller but food is superior. Thai restaurant has set menu but still enjoyable| there are only about 8 tables outside and is on first come first serve basis. We ate inside and just a little bit too hot and would have been better sitting in the open. Avoid the Buffet if you can. The Buffet used to be the reasons we returned to this resort but too many negatives. The Hotel are aware of this problem and I do believe they will improve this. Entertainment is live music in two separate areas and ok. Predominantly french guests.,London| United Kingdom,28-02-12,No,4
A wow kind of place!,"A big overhaul has been carried out here as my husband and I have seen the ""before"" and were amazed at the after. This hotel is now very mod| with classy| comfortable accommodation and surrounds. The softest powder white beaches (astonishing!)| a wonderful spa and the most fantastic kids club facility that you've ever seen| complete with a shallow baby pool are part of the offering. With over 100 pools they told us| in all shapes and forms this place is tranquil and inviting. Seek out the ancient banyan tree| it's something to behold. The suites have an outside shower| a lovely feature and showering under the stars for us is very African and special.The restaurants which you can visit at no extra charge for the set menu if you're on a breakfast and dinner package are outstanding. Really awesome food. In particular we were utterly charmed by Leckraj the manager at Mahiya| the Indian restaurant| who served us wonderful food in his beautiful restaurant. The Italian Il Corallo does an amazing antipasto. The wine cellar is a thing of beauty. The food at La Caravelle alongside| is also just wonderful. If you require good food and excellent service in a stylish setting then this place is for you. The wines| be warned| aren't cheap. One noticeable thing is that this is a large establishment| with 300 odd rooms and suites| so its not small and cosy| but there is enough space for all to spread out and enjoy. The plants are still small in places giving it an air of newness but in a short while they too will have found themselves at home and spread out! Find the meadow of reddish| grasses waving in the breeze - they are magical. Trou aux Biches is just stunning and well worth the trip.",Cape Town,28-02-12,No,5
If you are a discerning 5 star traveller | do not consider,My ratings for this Hotel/Resort with 1 as poor and 10 excellent for each catagory:a. Rooms and comfortablility - 9/10 - this because the room that we stayed in (the Senior Tropical Suite with own pool is large (163 sq m) an well equiped | however the interior decorations is clinical and minimalistic.b. Beach 6/10 - the beach is excellent and wide but you have to be perpared to share it with lots of outsiders from the surrounding areas. They sometimes put their towels right next to your lounger and security do nothing about it. Apparently all beaches in Mauritius is public property but here the outsiders absolutely take over. The swimming area in the sea is also very narrow to allow a passing lane for boats. Also hardly any service on the beach.c. Service levels : 4/10 The staff is under pressure because they are understaffed.There is virtually no service on the beach and at the restaurants you have to draw attention to get service. Not 5 star levels at all.d. Food : 7/10 Not bad but overpriced | and you have a variety of restaurants to choose from. e. Overall : 6/10 - If you pay 5 star prices you expect 5 star service levels etc. The resort is huge and I would hate to be there when it is full. During our stay the occupancy level was about 50% or less and they battled to cope.My opininion is that Beachcomber need to revise their busisness model here and regrade to the Hotel/Resort to 4 star and charge 4 star prices. Then they might be able to up the occupancy levels and employ more staff and overall improve on it.,JHB| South Africa,14-02-12,No,3
Big and impersonal,The hotel is too big and impersonal| feels like a big cruise ship with 5 nice restaurants but no personal service.The rooms are refurbished but most of them don't have any privacy overlooked from the gardens and pool area. No views to the sea apart from the beach front suites | I felt sorry for people staying there as these are very overlooked from the people walking on the beach. The rooms are infested by moschitos and when I asked the hotel for some spray I was told they are not moschitos but just flies| this was a lie and the guest relations manager applogised for the previous person simply liying in our face.The beach is great| yes the best but the sun lounges are so close | you can read the book of the person next to you.Great small restaurants for lunch just outside the hotel.The food in the hotel's a la carte restaurants is good but so overpriced | we had half board and you have to book well in advance your restaurant or you will end up with the buffer dinner which is very average.I will not return to this place as the service and facilities do not match 5 star hotel for the rates being charged by the hotel.,london,12-02-12,No,2
Cruise ship style hotel with very efficient service but not reflective of Mauritian warmth and luxurious hotels! Not good value ,Hotel recently rebuilt but does not have the warmth and Mauritian feel of the old one. The new is more in keeping with mass tourism hotels not reflective of Mauritian luxury hotels but at the same price. However the best hotel in Trou aux Biches. Excellent location| on a busy long fine white sandy beach where the lounge chairs are stacked next to each other.,London,28-01-12,No,3
Wonderful place| excellent food| paradise on the Earth,We visited this place after the renovation. From the first moment we were just surrounded by comfort| luxury care and beauty in every detail.We booked Tropical Junior suite and the outside shower was really great. Luxury bathroom and very nice view to the outside hotel pool. We loved the food. Every bite was delicious and my partner said he never tasted so great food. I have to agree.Very good cardio gym and I was pleased by possibility of spinning. Running run on the beach was great.Stuff was kind| helpful| but there were some mistakes in the service of the restaurant which should not happened in 5* hotel - e.g they bring the plate to your table| offering everything| helpful| but for the espresso after the meal we were always waiting. Once I had to go ask to the bar if they make fun from us or what does that mean....But regarding water sports| spa stuff| reception| cleaning stuff - all of them professional| kind and smiling all the time.The place is great value for the money. You are surrounded by beautiful nature| luxury spots| really great place for relaxing. We will be back. I visited more 5*+ hotels at Mauritius but this is the top for me.,Prague,13-01-12,No,5
Spoil yourself,I have visited the beautiful island of Mauritius 22 times. During January I stayed at thenew renovated Trou aux Biches - Beachcomber hotel in Mauritius. I stayed in a seniorsuite on the beach front. Truthfully I have never had such a large| beautiful suite| obviously itcomes at a price but it was worth every cent - it even had it's own swimming pool. The food was great| the staff excellent and overall a divine restful holiday.,Johannesburg| South Africa,11-01-12,No,5
Poor service in the best location,I was here from 31 december until 7 january. This is my second time in Mauritious after four years. First time I stayed in Le Cannonier. At Le Cannonier| bech was terrible| but rest was better although it was a four star hotel.I will mention good things first. Beach is the best in whole of Mauritious. If you are looking for beach and searching for an other hotel| you are simply wasting your time. Watersports is good| but there is no jetski around here. Design of the hotel is good. I stayed in family suit and it was very nice. There are many pools in the resort. Kids club is very good. Very close to a small town. 800 rupees return taxi| taxi waiting for you as much as you want.Not so good things are; flies and mosqitues. It is terrible. You can be beaten by 10 times in three minutes. Hotel is doing nothing about it. Flies are also bad especially if you are eating fish you must use one of your hand to chase flies all the time. Food is poor. I strongly advise the hotel to change the cook at the main restaurant. They must also choose good English speaking people for the reception. Entertainment was not as good as Le Cannonier. Hotel also is not designed for entertainment. It is more like relaxation area.If I go to this hotel| it will only because of the beach| otherwise it is not worthy at the price they are offering at all. I have been to resorts in Africa| Asia and Europa. This was below average for a five star service.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,08-01-12,No,3
Disappointing honeymoon,My husband and I stayed at Trou aux Biches for our honeymoon in October 2011 and were disappointed. The resort itself is beautiful and the rooms are amazing. The service however is very poor and unfriendly. The staff seemed to regard all requests as an imposition and did not make any effort to assist us when we asked for information on water sports| taxis| the spa and the restaurants.We also found that every time we returned to our room during the day there were staff in the room cleaning| replacing towels| counting the mini bar stock which does become irritiating when you are on holiday.On the whole we were left feeling very underwhelmed by the whole experience and will not be back.,Cape Town Central| South Africa,03-01-12,No,2
Beautiful place| but bad service and maintenance of the place.,I must say| it is a very beautiful hotel and a good beach by Mauritius standards. The check-in was fast and the first day was great. But we came across problems the first night when all of us got bitten by insects inside and outside of rooms. My child was badly bitten by spider and mosquitos the fist night and we ended up to suffer from the bites for the rest of our stay. We did pointed out this problem to the administration| but from what we saw the hotel did not do any fumigation| which is usually important for tropical places like that.The food was good| but the service most of the time was very slow.,Minsk| Belarus,03-01-12,No,3
What a disappointment !!! NOT a 5 star resort at all !!!,"Myself and my 10 yr old son checked in early December 2011. Resort looks wonderful and amazing BUT what a misleading experience. Food and buffet was very average| service was disgusting did not exist at all. Kids club does not exist my 10 yr old boy couldn't find a suitable activity to do as teen's club starts at 13 yrs of age and kids club only caters for up to 7 yrs old. So what is a 10 yr old child supposed to do there ? I spoke to resort manager Fatima who quickly "" allowed "" my child access to teen's club. My child was not allowed to eat at the Indian and Thai cuisine restaurants as he was too young too. So when I pay they quick to take my money but to deliver on there 5 star services ???Such a pity| what a wonderful resort but not in line with the money you pay and experience I would expect for a 5 star establishment.The only great thing about resort was the spa. Is was fantastic and service was very good. I met 2 other SA families who have respectively travelled to Mauritius more then 8 times and they too were very DISSAPOINTED.",Blantyre| Malawi,31-12-11,No,3
wonderful hotel on a perfect tropical beach,Just got back from a week at Trou aux biches. This was my 14th visit to Mauritius and the 7th hotel I have visited. The actual hotel has just been rebuilt and no expense has been spared| the rooms are by the far the best we have stayed in| and all the other resorts we have stayed at were also 5 star rated. We had a beachfront suite with private pool and verandah| we really didn't want to leave it and had to drag ourselves away at meal times. The beach is the best I have seen in Mauritius| soft white sand and crystal clear water and no sea weed of any kind which is quite a problem on the east coast of the island. It's a pity that the credit crunch has hit badly| the resort was only 40 % full and as it is a large resort it felt a bit empty at times. We always go at this time of year and usually it is packed. I feel that as a result of the lack of bookings they have cut down on staff as at times it felt like there were not enough staff on duty to keep the main dining area running smoothly. For example| when you get back to your table with your main course| the starter plates are still there so you have nowhere to put your plate. Also I ordered wine as soon as I arrived at the table| would go off to choose starters and the wine wouldn't arrive until I was half way through my main course. I know that this is not normal for Mauritian hotels| the service is usually excellent. The spa is beautiful| but I think it is very mean that you can only use the sauna/steamroom areas if you have booked a treatment. Other hotels allow use of these areas any time free of charge. Treatments are pricey so you're not going to have 1 every day. Just a few small criticisms| nothing that would spoil your holiday. Another plus point is that there i a Thomas Cook bureau de change 5 mins from the hotel where you get a much better rate than from the hotel and another 5 mins away there is a well stocked supermarket for buying any snacks/drinks at normal price instead of mini bar mad prices. You can take a taxi for 400 rupees if you're feeling lazy. All in all| a great holiday and I would definitely recommend it and would most likely go back again.,Blantyre| Malawi,22-12-11,No,5
Heaven in one place!!!!,We have just come back from a remarkable hotel at the Trou Au Biches. This is what 5 star service is about. The hotel is pricey but in this case you really get what you pay for. The resort is large but because the room are in blocks it never feels that way. We had a junior suite with excellent facilities. Big bath and shower| separate toilet| gorgeous big bed with down pillows and large balcony. The minibar is well- stocked and the rooms spacious and very clean. There is a magnificent beach| a huge main pool and various pools doored around. It never feels too crowded. Wonderful food| 5 star service and about the best hotel I've stayed in. Haven't stopped raving about it and can't wait to go back!!!!,Johannesburg| South Africa,13-12-11,No,5
Perfect Location . . . thats all . . .,"Take one of the best locations on the island| arguably the best beach on the island . . . add in wonderful tropical gardens and some amazing architectural designs| and what do you get?A spectacular dissapointment . . . .I found the food substandard and very limited. The buffet was awefull| both for dinner and breakfast. The Italian restaurant was a bit better. The suite was spacious and well designed . . . unfortunately they then gave it to an interior design company from the South Pole . . . The room was cold and austere with zero personallity. They did not capture any tropical or island warmth . . . just stark furniture and stark finishes . . . The service was terribly slow . . . check-in took ages and my ""confirmed booking with reservation number"" didnt exist on the system???But all that said . . . the resort location is truly awesome . . . the pools and layout is fantastic . . . just add the human touch . . .",Johannesburg| South Africa,28-11-11,No,2
Beautiful| luxury.....but,We were here in our honeymoon. Everything was beautiful and well-maintained. Restaurants to suit all tastes| and the food was good in all restaurants. The beach is long and beautiful and the sun beds were a short distance from the room.The staff was friendly and even seemed to range in the peace of our own would have liked more. The only thing bothered were some staff of expert knowledge and therefore they could not sometimes respond to requests. The spa was best spa where I ever have been.,Helsinki| Finland,28-11-11,No,4
Best Resort,I was last December and the hotel was still under construction. I wasn’t informed about that and I was very disappointed about it. Only two Restaurants were open and a small Bar.We stayed offcource at the new area in a Junior Suite and it was very nice. Really high quality materials and important for me very very clean. Stuff was also very helpful. Beach was also very nice because nearby right from Resort the beach was with stones. Brekfast buffet had a gut variety from all want you wish. Prices were a bit high but ok you are on holidays. We had a free late checkout accommodation| Thank you very much.I really recommend this resort if someone looks for a high quality accommodation.Yes I will be back again| I hope soon!!!!!!,Pirgos Hellas,27-11-11,No,5
Infrastructure stunning| few more things needed to achieve perfection,The place was beautiful - the reception| the restaurants| the pools| the beech| our room and terrace. This cannot be faulted. Absolutely stunning. The food was also a very high standard. The rooms were kept immaculately clean. The spa was beautiful| the water sports were great. However| there are a few things that are needed to make this a real world class 5 star hotel| it certainly has the potential. The majority of the service was very good (although you could tell that they had been trained to do certain things| e.g. top up your wine at set times when actually in a hot country you want your wine in the ice bucket as long as possible! ) but sometimes the service was not 5 star. The staff were not always friendly and good service did not come naturally to the majority of the staff. Also when you are at a 5 star hotel| you don’t want stray cats wondering around the restaurants and they really need separate smoking areas. The biggest gripe we had was the billing system. We were on half board plus and it was very confusing. When we arrived| nobody really explained to us how it worked and what we were entitled to| we had to go back to reception to find out. During the entire stay| we then had to explain the system to most of the staff at lunch and dinner. At lunch you could have 2 courses each and a drink which was fine but dinner was confusing. We had to explain to the waiters what wine was include in our package. In the restaurants| you had to have the set menu| if you went off the set menu you had to pay A LOT of money for the privilege (when you have paid £8K for 10 days it seemed they were taking the mick a bit). You had credits off the a la carte selection but only 450 rupee off the main and 150 off the dessert| but the desserts were 500 rupee. Its strange you could spend a fortune on two courses at lunch but then you are restricted at dinner| e.g. you could have a crème Brule for lunch dessert but it wasn’t on the set menu so you to pay £10 extra for this at dinner. A bit hard to explain| but it felt you were a second class citizen when you had to stick to the set menu. Piece of advice if you like water sports| don’t leave it till the last minute to do things as they do not allow you to sail on your own for a couple of days and likewise the water skiing could take more than 3 days before you can learn to do this properlyOverall a lovely place for a honeymoon| the resort is stunning and paradise – a few bits needed to improve and this hotel would be perfection.,Oxford| United Kingdom,20-11-11,No,4
Excellent resort| highly recommended,This is a lovely resort with friendly & helpful local staff. Our Junior Suite plus was great and the outdoor shower a real bonus. The choice of restaurants was good and the food in each one was excellent quality. We were a bit worried about being on 'half board' basis but you could substitute items from the a la carte menu (for a small supplement) if you didn't like the stated options that evening. 1 local beer (Phoenix - delicious!) each was also complimentary with the evening meal. The facilities are all very modern and it was a peaceful & relaxing place to chill out for a few days. We would definitely return,Dubai,19-11-11,No,5
Very nice factory hotel,Initially on check in we decided to upgrade to a senior suite| after 4 hours I had to chase up the initial request. As a result of this we ended up waiting in our initial room for this period. The reason why this had happened was human error and the check in operator forgot to continue with our request and he finished work without telling anybody.Finally we moved to the senior suite and all was great| the room was beautiful and well presented and the outside areas including pool well organised and clean.The food in the hotel was of a high standard and the various restaurants had alot to offer.We chose the the all full board plus option| this included half a bottle of wine per person with dinner and a drink at lunch. Water over and above this is not included. On our first night rather than have full bottle of wine between us| we decided to have 2 small glasses of wine each| however on signing for our meal we had to pay for the wine. The waiter had given us wine that was not included in the full board plus option| I tried to challenge this| however with no avail. In essence when you ask for your drinks make sure that they are included in your package.On the second night we went to the indian restaurant| the food was great. However although this time I asked for the wine that was included in our package. At the end of the meal on checking what i was signing for| again i had a bottle of wine added to the bill. I challenged this and they taken the wine off the bill as it should have been included. Although all service was good| i recommend that you check your bill after all meals.I am someone who is very generious with tips| too generious in fact| so the service we received may have been above what the standard was. I believe once word got round the hotel that we tipped well| i found service personnel loitering or trying to get my attention at ever opportunity| i believe to receive a favour. Therfore i recommend that you select who you like the most and tip them at the end of your stay to prevent any discomfort.The grounds| restaurants and rooms in the hotel are amazingly clean and well serviced.The hotel is a big hotel| what we call a factory hotel| however with the vast amount of swimming pools and restaurants| you feel that you are in a smaller hotel as the noise levels are low. Effectively very well designed to cater for so many guests.The spa although a little expensive is worth the trying out| the areas within the spa are well kept and the service is very good.The honeymoon package includes a bottle of champagne| fruit bowl| a gift each from the boutique shop| and a head and back massage each| a nice little touch for honeymooners. Although this is now becoming more standard in most hotels.All in all a very relaxing stay and trou aux biches although initially failing| pulled it out the hat in the end. Possibly the only thing required of the hotel is for it publish entitlements for all guest on arrival and to brief staff better| to allow them to please the customer rather than make a further sale.,London,14-11-11,No,4
Great location | great facilities spoilt by bad service and substandard food .,We holidayed at the recently rebuilt Trou Aux Biches resort and spa last month for a much needed break | and after previous holidays in Mauritius we expected friendly Mauritian service and hospility| a great beach holiday and good food . Our visit was to prove to be a mix of good and bad... Good news was that the accommodation and facilities were brand new and superb | the villas | rooms | bathrooms | gardens and sports facilities were well designed and absolutely outstanding.(A minor downside of the two and three bedroom luxury villas is that they're on a main road which can get noisy and they're a good walk from the beach and restaurants).The restaurants however were a different story | they lacked character | food quality was poor and the service mediocre to unfriendly .The breakfast area was like a large featureless black hole and the choice and quality of the breakfast offering was astoundingly bad ? The pool area whilst pretty as a feature was like a large lake ( no atmosphere |no music | no service | no guests ....) unlike the pool areas we 'd enjoyed on previous visits to Maurituian hotels and resorts . Trou Aux Biches is situated on a magnificent beach and the service on the beach ( towels | drinks and meals was pretty good ) but the watersports staff ( like many of the staff we encountered at the front desk | sports centre | shops | conscierge and restaurants ) were unfriendly and it often felt like they were doing you a favor and didn't really want to be serving you - odd for a brand new resort and the well established Beachcomber Hotel Group ? The spa was large and very well designed but once again the service was unfriendly and impersonal and we had mixed experiences with the treatments | some OK | some very bad | felt like a trainee testing her skills rather than qualified professionals . In summary Trou aux biches offers wonderful facilities on Maurititius's best beach | but the atmosphere | food and service we experienced meant we never truly relaxed and we regret not booking into either the St.Gerain or Le Touessrok resorts where we 've previously had memorable holidays in spectacular locations | were pampered with great service | really good cuisine | in a fun and thoroughly relaxing environment . Think carefully before booking into Trou Aux Biches | there are far better options in. Mauritius in this price range .,London,12-11-11,No,3
Highly Recommended,We recently had 10 nights at the Trou aux Biche and absolutely loved it. Our accommodation was excellent| the food superb| beach and facilities first class| and the staff very friendly and attentive.

Wedding,Very briefly| We got married here in August| perfect week and wedding day totally relaxing everything was taken care of| beautiful meal on the beach| friendly staff| food in the italian is great. Lovely beach and sunsets. Stayed in a few hotels on the island and this was the best| although drinks pricey and you don't get any water in your room| this would have been a nice touch as its 5*!Cant wait to go back some day| totally recommend.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,01-11-11,No,5
Many are called.....few are chosen,We stayed in a Family Suite at Trou aux Biches in September/October 2011 for a holiday with our children aged 4 and 6 on a half board package. It is difficult to articulate in a brief review anything that will do justice to this amazing resort| however I will do my best.Beachcomber have deployed a tonne of capital in making this a premier destination and it really shows. All the rooms have been totally re-built with layouts designed with intelligence and functionality in a true 5 star class. The facilities are jaw dropping| from the amazing day spa to the well appointed Gym and exercise room with all new shiny equipment. The gigantic central pool to the smaller pools in amongst the suites| the state of the art kids club complete with Bose home theatre/karaoke machine and iMacs| its all there| all new and all great.However| its not just the toys like the brand new ski boats and sail craft adorning the amazing beach which make this place so special. No its more than that. Its the organisation culture (sorry to use filthy business terms in a leisure review) which makes this place. Somehow| beachcomber have achieved the holy grail of management| they have built a close to faultless culture where staff are constantly trying to please and surprise with amazing service. Nothing is too much trouble| nothing. The turn down service complete with pyjamas folded out on the bed| children's toys tucked in ready for cuddling| the specially made eggless pancakes for my egg allergy suffering son| the later than late checkout (thanks Armand)| the earlier than early check in!! It just goes on and on. How have they done it?? Surely they have replaced all the staff with some type of programmable cyborg which is incapable of poor service and is constantly trying to please and surprise. Clearly I jest| however if you have been searching for an example of the gold standard in service| your long search has ended.I could go on and on about this place| but I would just say go and book it....waste no more time looking| as time is our most precious resource.Is it perfect...of course not. If you look hard enough| you can find fault in anything. There were mosquitoes which sometimes found there way into our unscreened room (quickly solved with staff supplying electronic repellers) and the constant hawkers on the beach can be a pest| however if you go with a good attitude you would be hard pressed to be disappointed.Note: This is a genuine review with no encouragement from beachcomber. I am not employed or associated with Beachcomber. If you doubt my credentials refer to me less than favourable review of Shandrani| another Beachcomber resort.,Byron Bay| Australia,31-10-11,No,5
Honeymoon,Many honeymooners in this fantastic renovated hotel (all is new).Excellent SPA| six restaurants - we eated at five| not in the Thai one. The buffet was great but the Italian restaurant is the best one!Beautiful beach| friendly and professional waiters. If you want| you can play tennis or doing many other sports (yoga| gym| water sports): all for free. After dinner you can see every night a different show (sega| local music| international music ect)We will be back| sure!,Roma,15-10-11,No,5

A return visit after 10 years,We have just returned from Trou aux Biches after s[ending 12 days at the new complex. We went there ten yaers ago on honeymoon. It's much bigger now but we found the rooms| gardens and beach immaculate. They seemed to have thought of everything and one call to Room Service or Housekeeping and we found someone at the door in minutes. Yes| the buffet was a bit samey every day but the choice was good. We eat at the Italian restaurant most nights and the food and service was of a very high standard. A special thanks to Winnie Jane (Guest Relations) and Menon (Room Services Manager) for making our Anniversary so special. We did find| however| the main bar at night lacked charisma and was quite empty. This could be down to the inflated price of drinks.,Nottingham,21-09-11,No,5
Trou aux Biches now rebuilt,I spent three nights at this new flagship of the beachcomber group| the room i stayed was very comfortable| the shower bathroom area tops| bed and pillows are among the best i slept in. The food unfortunately not so great| the wine list for half board was very mediocre| the Restaurants are spread too far apart| Management must take a serious look at this. It seems that a lot of money was spent at this resort| the beach is superb.The service leaves a lot to be desired specially in the main restaurant.,Durban,20-09-11,No,4
A dream come true,So far I stayed in six hotels in Mauritius but the 2 nights stay that we experienced in Trou aux Biches Hotel was far more outstanding. I was staying there from 16 sep to 18 sep 20011 with my husband| my five year old daughter Laksha| mum| dad. Everything was fabulous| food| the cocktails| the way the employees smile and greet you the whole day. The suites we stayed in were spacious and clean. The restaurants offers tasty food at the buffet. All services we required were rapid. The staffs from the mini club were very professional. It was the very first time that my daughter stayed willingly in a mini club and she even became fond of it.,Curepipe,18-09-11,No,5
Honeymoon Sep 11,My husband and I have just returned from an 11 night stay at this newly furbished resort. Overall we would say it was fantastic. The setting is absolutely stunning and our room (beach front with plunge pool) was gorgeous. Very clean| plenty of space and just 20m from the beach - ideal! The restaurants on the whole were very good - both in terms of quality of food and service. The main buffet restaurant did at times let the food side down - waiting for replenisments and was a bit 'samey' every day but for lunch time this wasn't particularly a problem. We did need to book in advance for dinner in the other 5 restaurants though as they were booked up very quickly but so long as you plan in advance it's ok. The quality of food and service (particularly in the Thai and Indian) were extremely high. We chose to pay a bit extra for our special honeymoon dinner in order to have this on the beach. The food was amazing and the service second to none - in fact| almost too attentive - I would have liked a little more privacy if anything.Weather was mixed but it was winter so I guess to be expected| however| there were always plenty of beds available on the beach (we didn't use any of the pool areas as we had our own deck and pool with the villa) as well as an abundance of beach towels available daily.One word of warning though is the cost of drinks. We were on a honeymoon package which included one drink with lunch (wine or beer) and half a bottle of wine each with dinner. This was sufficient for us but the one time we went to the bar for a drink after dinner it was around £13 for a Jack Daniels - a bit steep even for a a 5*. However| we did take some Gin with us (on offer in duty free so couldn't resist!!) and bought tonic from the local supermarket up the road. We were brought canapes and a bucket of ice around 5pm every afternoon (very nice touch) which made for a great opportunity for us to make our own aperitif before dinner!As part of the package we had a 'honeymoon couple' massage. The spa layout and facilities were absolutely idylic but the massage itself left a bit to be desired in my opinion. Being someone who fairly regularly goes to spa's etc it didn't make me want to book further treatments (as they asked us if we'd like to on the way out) but I could have just been unlucky with the beautician I had. The head massage part of the treatment was more of a scratching of my scalp and tickling my ears! Overall I would highly recommend this hotel - particularly for a special occasion holiday. Having read some of the other reviews| I'm unsure of why there was a problem with service as for 99% of the time we found it to be spot on.,Geneva| Switzerland,15-09-11,No,5
Certainly NOT relaxing,On arrival before we checked in we asked for our credit card !! Our room was not available but we were told it should be within an hour so we went to make a booking at the restaurant . Our first 2 choices were closed that evening . When we got to our room and started unpacking a maid wandered in without knocking - just as well werent in shower or ..... In the evening we went to turn air conditioning but it didnt work !! We chased up reception / duty manager with the result we had engineers climbing all over the room when we wanted to change for dinner . We complained !! How we complained !!! but we will told the resort management coudnt compensate or give us extra night as it had to be dealt with by UK end . After huge amount of effort received 25% for first night . See photos for how our room looked !! Thank goodness we had only booked 4 nights,York| United Kingdom,14-09-11,No,2
Disappointed by the service,The layout is absolutely amazing| fantastic beach but service was a lot lower than I expected...there were issues with table availability| food replenishment and other small requests. Great hotel if service is not a huge requirement of yours.,Dubai| United Arab Emirates,04-09-11,No,3
Fabulous Holiday,We have recently returned from a 9 night stay at Trou aux Biches Resort and I only have good things to say about this hotel. We were lucky enough to have a beachfront suite with a pool| which I can highly recommend. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were very spacious and well appointed. Having our own plunge pool was fantastic and with the beach just meters from our patio| well it was exactly what I had hoped for.Before going on this holiday I did a lot of research on hotels in Mauritius as I needed a hotel that would be suitable for my husband who is in a wheelchair. I am happy to say that I made the right choice as this is a wheelchair friendly hotel which allowed my husband to be independent in getting around the resort. Whilst making our reservation | the hotel had been most helpful in answering my many questions and providing me with all kinds of details and even photographs to ensure that our holiday would be as stressless as possible. Once there I found all the staff to be very friendly and always ready to assit us whenever we needed it| and even when we did not.As mentioned in some other reviews| drinks were expensive but then this is a 5 star hotel and as we were on the Halfboard Plus Package which included lunch and a limited amount of drinks with lunch and dinner| this did not affect us too much. We did discover that there is a local supermarket just down the road from the hotel where you are able to buy bottled water and cooldrinks for a much lower price.The beach is simply beautiful and the sunsets were amazing. Our 2 year old daughter loved every minute of her holiday as did her parents !,Johannesburg| South Africa,30-08-11,No,5
Fabulous renovation- best beach in Mauritius!,"Architecture excellent| great lay out| 6 restaurants within the resort. Kids club| coolest Apple products in teen club| great gym| beautiful gardens| magnificent spa - all sound too good to be true? Im afraid so! The resort service is NOT 5 star! The food is so ordinary. The spa? My husband and I specifically requested a couple massage| yet were taken to separate rooms? The spa reception ask what type if music you preffer| and then play something entirely different?? The treatment is okay - not the standard one expects from a 5 star resort! We booked in on a fully inclusive package| only to discover this is not the same as ""all inclusive""?? Basically is means you are on a full board package| 3 meals| including one drink at Lunch| and 1/2 bottle of wine at dinnernper person. Should you want a cold drink on the beach| you'd have to pay (handsomely) for it - IF| really IF you find service!!!! I've been to 4 star hotels in MUR with better service and meals - I suggest management get their act together - and fast! ",Mauritius,27-08-11,No,4
The last word in excellence!,My wife and I have recently stayed in the Trou Aux Biches Resort and Spa for my honeymoon and we were not disappointed. The beach front villas have their own plunge pools and are aproximately 30ft from the sea. there are 6 different resauraunts to choose from all of which rotate their menus every 3-4 days and all speciaise in different cuisine.The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them.if sandy beaches and cocktails by the pool are your thing then i would highly recommend Trou Aux Biches!We will definately be returning,Guernsey| United Kingdom,17-08-11,No,5
Amazing Family Resort,We stayed at Trou aux Biches Resort for 2 weeks with our 2 children aged 10 & 8. We stayed in a family suite which was very spacious with 2 bedrooms| 2 bathrooms and an out door shower. The weather was a very nice 25 degrees with a mixture of sun and cloud. We did experience a couple of days of rain but you can't guarantee 14 days of sun no matter what time of year you go. The resort has been beautifully refurbished to a very high standard with attention to detail. The bar areas were lovely to sit in and have a cocktail in the evening and the entertainment tended to be low key with a pianist or a small band.  The food in the restaraunts was very good with excellent variety| however I do think they need to work on the service. Maybe we were unlucky but there were numerous occasions at breakfast| lunch and dinner when we had to wait quite a while to recieve our drinks. On one occasion at breakfast we were served off milk and on one occasion we had to wait 45 minutes before we recieved our starter at dinner.The main pool was very large| pretty but slightly chilly due to the time of year| not that it bothered the kids. Due to the season and because the final suites aren't yet finished| there was ample room around the pool with many free sun beds.I'm not sure it will feel like this when the resort is fully open in peak season.Both our kids did use the kids club and there were a variety of activities planned. I think our 10 year old is getting to an age where he finds a lot of the activities a little babyish so I would say that although it caters for up to 12 year olds| the closer they get to 12 the less attractive it becomes .The kids club was beautifully kitted out and the teens area was amazing too.What really made our holiday an amazing holiday was the water based activities. Special mention to Christine| Mitishi and Jeff. The fact we could do water ski ing & wake borading morning and afternoon at no extra cost was a real bonus. We also made very good use of the tennis facilities.This was our third trip to Mauritius ( we stayed at the Heritage and Sugar Beach on the other occasions). We might go again and we would deffinately consider Trou Aux Biches over the other 2 resorts we stayed at. Although I have highlighted a few issues I'd still give this resort 5/5 as we had a most amazing holiday.,Surrey,09-08-11,No,5
Could they improve on the old Trou aux Biches?,Having stayed at the old Trou aux Biches 5 times previously| we were looking forward to returning after a break of 3 years while they resort was being redeveloped. We were a little concerned that Beachcomber may have taken away the special atmosphere TaB has but that concern disappeared the moment we were welcomed by the hotel's reception staff. Beachcomber have done a remarkable job of turning what we thought was a top hotel into an even better one. Most of the staff from the old hotel have been kept on and as ever their attention to detail helped make our holiday very special. A special mention must go to Menon| head of room service for which nothing was too much trouble. Also Jay in the Caravelle Restaurant who made our lunches a joy. Highly recommend the Indian restaurant. Looking forward to our next stay,Sevenoaks| United Kingdom,01-08-11,No,5
Beautiful new resort,My friend and I stayed at this lovely hotel for the final 5 days of a wonderful holiday in Mauritius. the service was amazing and the choice of restaurants and quality of food you could not fault. We especially enjoyed the Indian restaurant with great food| entertainment and beautiful decor. We were on half board and with the renovations deal| it included breakfast| lunch and dinner with a bottle of wine for dinner and a glass of wine or beer for lunch. The only thing I could fault with such a high quality new resort was that the attention to detail as at other resorts was not quite as good- no complimentary bottled water in room| iPod dock| beach service and the variety of activities offered at fitness centre lacked variety and skill. It is in a great location| just a bus ride to Grande Baie and a walk to the local supermarket. The sand and water are pristine and we spent mornings taking long walks checking out the coastline and nearby resorts.,Sydney,29-07-11,No,5
Excellent stay| highly recommended for those who want to relax in a luxurious environment,"First stay at ""the trou aux biches"" resort and spa| Mauritius. Austral winter here but still very pleasant place to be with around 25 degrees and mix of sun and clouds. This resort was totally refurbished and it s a success. Five stars hotel plus| warm welcome and good level of service through all facilities| from the reception to the room and restaurants. We stay in a junior suite tropical wit external shower.It s a perfect room looking at the gardens and swimming pool. Beach is fantastic| one of the most beautiful of the island on the west coast (less windy in winter)and sunny. Amazing food in all restaurants (caravelle| ginger| the deck| the Italian one). Waterspout activities are included| tennis and fitness room are new and offer different kind of courses from yoga to spinning. Spa is very nice with a good offer of treatments without being too extensive. Prices for spa are in the average for such type resorts without exaggeration and with bargain if taken before 3pm.For whom? People who want to relax but also doing some activities| quite enough for couples| family with children ok but this is not a club med. In summary| enjoy the life here by staying at the beach looking at the sunset| sleeping well| relaxing at the spa and eating the Mauritian gastronomy| will come back for sure. And .... Best period for Mauritius is well between June and October| low season | less people and better prices from luxurious resorts.",Brussels| Belgium,25-07-11,No,5
Best Honeymoon Destination,From the moment we arrived we had an amazing time| the staff and the resort we just second to none. We were made feel very welcome and everyone was so friendly. The quality of the resort was just fantastic and the standard of food was just amazing. I will be taking my wife back there at some point to relive our beautiful honeymoon.,Royal Wootton Bassett| United Kingdom,11-07-11,No,5
Perfect Honeymoon!,We spent a week at Trou Aux Biches for our honeymoon and had the most amazing time! The resort is located on the best side of Mauritius to ensure you get the best weather and least wind. The resort is spectacular. You feel as though you are in paradise| caught in a bubble of perfection. Even though it is a fairly large resort| you feel as though you are quite secluded and given the right amount of privacy. We stayed in a beach front suite which has the most gorgeous views of the crystal clear blue sea and it's own decking with a plunge pool. The villa was spacious and had the biggest bathroom ever with a monsoon shower| outdoor shower and deep bath (perfect for 2!). We spent most of the time by the main pool since it was so peaceful and provides great vistas. Even though there is still work going on to finish the refurbishment| we really couldn't tell and weren't bothered by it at all. Don't let that put you off. The food was great. We thought that if there was going to be anything that let a resort like this down it would be the quality of food (since it's hard to get everything right) but we were wrong. The quality of the food (at every sitting - breakfast| lunch and dinner) is very high. If you are a foodie| you will not be disappointed! The staff are all extremely friendly and keen to please. Perhaps the only bit of feedback we'd give is that we would sometimes have 2-3 people serving our table (in an effort to deliver superior service) but sometimes it was overwhelming for us. The variety of water sports/activities you could participate in were great too (not that I did much)| but my husband really enjoyed the water skiing! If you also like to stay active during trips| the gym was really well equipped and tennis courts were great. They also had a lot of stuff to keep kids/teenagers occupied too. June is actually winter in Mauritius but we found the temperature was great because it was hot enough to tan without being uncomfortable and there were only a few sporadic showers which cleared practically as soon as they had started. We are an English/Swedish couple so getting the right climate was important for us. Highly recommend this place for a luxury holiday or honeymoon!,London| United Kingdom,26-06-11,No,5
Amazing,I stayed here for one night last week. What a lovely resort. It has a stunning 2 km long beach. It has numerous restaurants so there is a choice of where one would like to eat from seafood| Thai| Italian and a few others. My room was very modern and spacious and even had an inside shower as well as an outside shower. The bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel to other travellers if they are looking for an upmarket resort with a beautiful beach.,Umtentweni,14-06-11,No,5
Paradise !,A once in a lifetime resort experience. Attention to detail beyond reproach. Idyllic location| service at your fingertips| food to savour & sunsets to die for ...,Mauritius,13-06-11,No,5
best birthday gift!,We went with my husband and son| the hotel has been entirely renovated and the result is very good. The room was perfect| the pools| the spa| the gym| mini club| restaurants and especially the beach. The food was very good| and every lunch they did something differentThere was also a large choice of restaurants inside the hotel for the night. And the atmosphere was very very romantic :)They were still finishing a part from the hotel but from the beach and the rooms we hardly heard a noise... just from the entry of the hotel... so not a problem at allThe mini club was very good| well equipped and with nice activities for the little ones. My son had a great time and the opening hours were adapted for parents so they could always eat alone.I highly recommend it!,Lisbon| Portugal,08-06-11,No,5
the most beautiful piece of paradise in the world,My 9 month son and I were incredibly lucky to be treated by my brother to a 10 night stay at this wonderful hotel. The staff are friendly| polite and attentive. Our huge suite had it's own pool and was our outdoor shower where you showered under the Milky Way..amazing. If you are able to drag yourself away form the stunning infinity pool or powder white sand then there is every type of water sports available and an incredibly well resources gym| tennis courts and spa complex. The hotel boasts 5 restaurants and I have never tasted such amazing food anywhere in the world. When can I return?,Canterbury| United Kingdom,10-05-11,No,5
Indeed 5 star or more,Although the Resort is still under construction (of which they had informed us at the time of booking) we were very impressed. Because of building works still going on| we were offered free lunch every day and half a bottle of wine each at dinner. I was really impressed by the food. The new Trou aux Biches doesn't look anything of what it looked like before| so all reviews from 2009 and earlier should be ignored. Best beach in Mauritius. Very friendly staff. They were already very efficient at the moment of booking.,Dublin,11-03-11,No,5
Beautiful place and great service - still opening up though,Trou aux Biches was a beautiful place to stay. About half of the area has been opened (main restaurant area and half of the accommodation is still being developed) but it didn't pose any issues for our stay. In fact if anything it probably made it better as because of this we had lunch and wine included with meals when on half board.It also meant that the Thai and Indian restaurants were housed in small villas. This meant rather than big restaurant areas it was intimate dinners by a small pool central to the villa - a much better experience.Service on all levels was great| and we would highly recommend the Indian restaurant for dinner - amazing food and wonderful service.The beach the hotel is set on is large and the hotel provides a range of water sports (catamaran| water skiing etc). Fitness centre is also high class. So would have no doubts recommending Trou aux Biches. I'd also recommend the day on the catamaran and swimming with dolphin outings if you can while in Mauritius.,Sydney| Australia,09-02-11,No,5
Beautiful suites and layout.,We only had a guided tour and lunch| but would certainly consider staying. I loved the first floor beach villas| spacious| own pool| access by steps to beach| view of the sea. Only stayed for buffet lunch| but there was loads of choice and service was good. I mentioned your reports of slow service and they were aware of the comments| but feel that it is now fine as the team get used to working together. Although all the old staff were kept on throughout the renovation| so as not to lose their good staff| they are working together in different groupings and now feel that they are on top of things.,Aylesbury| United Kingdom,07-02-11,No,5
Fabulous Resort,We stayed for 10 days last december in a senior suite with pool| just in front of the beach. The hotel was under soft opening due to the works not being finished on one part of the hotel. We will not comment on the works as we were aware before going there.Our room was very spacious| with a perfect view for the sunset. The pool is quite large (6x4). The bathroom is huge and we liked the outside shower.Although not all the restaurants were open| we managed to have a taste of the future range of cuisine that will be offered| and we were quite impressed by the quality of the chefs.The beach is one of the best of Mauritius| though it is a public beach.A very good resort| that will be perfect when fully finished and the grass fully grown. A special thanks to all the hotel staff for their kindness and availability during our stay.,Paris| France,05-02-11,No,5
Lovely rooms| location| service sloppy,I am happy to say that service in the restaurant last night was dramatically better| so perhaps Anton's thoughts reached them. Food has been consistently good| but previously| service had been sloppy| coffee machine broken| then fixed 20 minutes later| orders lost| drinks slow to arrive| needing several reminders etc. Have to say i had a lovely facial and my daughter| who got married here on 11/1/11| also enjoyed her treatments. The grounds are obviously in development| but the plantings are good. I really enjoyed the outside shower| even in the rain. We haven't even used the inside one. My daughter's wedding went very well - they supplied a celebrant| musicians| beach setting and a lovely dinner| at it was as casual as the couple wanted. Final grouch is that men must wear long pants to dinner. My husband is of the opinion that when you pay heftily for accommodation| you should be able to wear neat dress shorts| and i agree. We are in the tropics guys! Its hot and humid at night!!,Darwin| Australia,12-01-11,No,4
Nice resort| but could be better,"I have just came back from this resort| and overall had a nice time. Here are a few points I'd like to shareThe hotel grounds: Nice and spacious| but at the time of my visit 1/3 was still not completed.The rooms: I stayed at the beach pool villa and it was amazing| even though pricey.The service was sloppy. It was common for waiters to forget orders| for reception to forget what you asked for| and room service breakfast is served randomly- I don't know what they put menus on the door knobs for. Staff are generally kind but seems to be nicer to French speakers| rather than English speakers. Food: there are 6 restaurants| but only two work for lunch. I one day went to a ""Mediterranean buffet"" to find few nearly empty salad plates| lamb curry and 3 different types of rice.. The situation is better for dinner| but nearly all restaurants serve set menus. The beach is nice| but a bit crowded. There are motor boats racing close to the swimming area. All in all it is a nice resort| but there are certainly a number of things that could be improved.",London| United Kingdom,09-01-11,No,4
I had the best holiday!,I am a repeter of the Trou aux Biches. I went back there to see the new hotel. It is just amazing. The design and architecture are beautiful. The sea is still turquoise in front of the restaurants. This hotel is just lovely and the staff as well. Thank you very much to the staff for this perfect holiday.,Liverpool UK,28-12-10,No,5
Wonderful hotel!!!,If you ever travel to Mauritius i strongly recommend trou aux biches hotel at trou aux biche beach....the sea and the sand is wonderful and the hotel also...All the stuff was very kind polite and helpful..The restaurants and the food especially sea food was delicius!!!and the spa....WOH!! My husband and i really looking forward to go again!!!!!!!!,Thessaloniki| Greece,03-11-09,No,5
Highly enjoyable| but will the refurbishment spoil it?,"I've stayed at the Trou Aux Biches twice and thoroughly enjoyed both experiences.The thatched individual bungalows were well spaced out in the wonderful gardens which led to the white coral sand beach. Plenty of sun loungers were available both on the beach and round the sparkling pool. Contrary to other reports I didn't find them to be either broken or dirty.Admittedly| the decor of the rooms was looking rather tired latterly| but then this was not a spanking new hotel and how much time do you actually spend in your hotel room when you're in a tropical beach resort?The staff at the hotel were absolutely first rate. At both breakfast and dinner you even had your plate carried to your table in the restaurant after helping yourself from the buffet. At breakfast a delicious selection of French breads was available. Particularly impressive were the immaculate uniforms of the restaurant staff. I do hope that they will be able to retain the services of these highly efficeint professionals after the full refurbishment has taken place.The food was varied and extremely well presented.Criticism has been made of the hawkers on the beach. I personally didn't have a problem with them. I did purchase some Mauritian T shirts from a delightful character called David on my first visit and I was disappointed not to see him again the second time. Of course you were approached by every hawker as he/she walked past you| but I found that they remembered that you had said ""No thank you"" when they came past again and they didn't bother you again.One of the nicest things about the Trou Aux Biches were the numerous tropical birds that inhabited the grounds. These birds were relatively tame| so it was easy to take nice photos of them. I hope that the possible destruction of their habitat during the rebuilding programme won't drive them away completely. It was noticeable at the more modern Shandrani that there were nowhere near as many birds in the grounds as there had been at the Trou Aux Biches.It remains to be seen what the new Trou Aux Biches will be like. I understood from one of the Reception staff that new rooms will also be built on the golf course land across the road. I do hope that the resort won't be so large that the beach won't be able to cope with many more additional visitors.",Tweed Heads| Australia,07-04-09,No,5
Perfect honeymoon! Look out it will be renewed in 2009,We spent 10 days at the Troux aux Biches for our honeymoon. We had the best time ever. The hotel is very big and there's a lot of privacy as the bungalows are very separated from each other. The vegetation is beautiful and colourrful. The best of it all| were the water activities as they were all included: ski and wakeboard all the times you want| snorkel at the reef| hobbykat and laser| kayak... There's a very good gym and tenis courts as well.The bedrooms are a little bit all-fashioned but they are ok anyways.The beach is very long as the hotel is big and extended| so you can perfectly have privacy at the beach. There are a lot of hawkers as the beach is public| but they are very friendly and they do not bother at all.The main restorant has a very good breakfast and buffet at nigth. And I hardly recommend to go at least one night to L'Espadon| a beautiful and small restorant on the beach where we ate delicious seafood and lobster.The hotel is set on the west cost of Mauritius| so we got to enjoy beautiful sunsets and the wind is not so disturbing as in the east cost of the island. Watch out for the rainy season! You can walk all along the beach to a near supermarket where we buy drinks and water as they are not included in the full-board. It's very safe. LOOK OUT! They are planning to renewed the whole hotel in 2009. They are planning to do a lot more bedrooms| so the quiet and privacy that's the best thing of the hotel| I'm not sure you will have them after the remodelling.One day we went to Grand Baie| where Le Mauricia Hotel is located (another Beachcomber hotel) and we liked much more ours. Le Mauricia has a very little beach with no view| because it's in a bay| and all the bedrooms are in one big building.Enjoy Tro aux Biches because it's very very good!!!,Buenos Aires| Argentina,22-11-08,No,5
Unique type of setting and experience,This was a very good hotel experience for my husband and I. We had 10 days there and I am a really fussy type of holiday person. Firstly the accommodation comprises of thatch cottage set in lovely gardens with pathways winding through but not immediately on top of the cottages. The accommodation comprises of a really large bedroom area leading off to bathroom| seperate loo and fitted wardrobe area. Everything was kept really clean by the very efficient room assistant on a daily basis and nothing too much trouble. Extra towels etc when needed. Fabulous food I have to say with extensive menu. Check which menu you should order from on arrival. Helpful reception staff. The things we loved about our stay: Children had a seperate restuarant to us and had a fab area just for them if required with low tables and chairs etc so did not interfere with our holiday. Beautiful beach with beach waiter service for drinks and food and very quick. The excursions (can be booked at just by reception) and transport very effective and collected us on time - we went on 3 trips the best being the Black River Dolphins and one out to an Island with just the most amazing setting and stunning food. Really excellent holiday we would definately go back there. Really friendly smiley staff always willing to help you. We were hugely disappointed with the vast amount of damage done to the coral around the island but nothing to do with the hotel obviously but quite shocked at the extent of the damage. There is a really good taxi service immediately outside the hotel complex and they will accommodate most requirements but you need to ask - they speak good English too. And for us the sun shone every day with rain coming in the very early hours of the morning only.,Bedfordshire,09-11-08,No,4
Loved it!,After much ooohing and aahhing we decided to take the plunge and take the holiday to Mauritius and chose trou aux biches (NW side) to avoid the September winds and stay at the best beach!We had a wonderful time (7 days and nights) and had no problems at all. We had a superior room which was v. spacy and although we had no view of the beach| it didnt matter much.As vegetarians we had no problem with food and the service was excellent!The beach was absolutly superb and the water was crystal clear. You can see fish whilst you are swimming. The hotel has various free water activities that one can enjoy.The hotel is closng in Jan 2008 for refurbishment so go and enjoy it now!,London,19-10-08,No,5
Paradise on earth,We have just returned from our honeymoon at TAB Hotel and we really had great time there. In style| TAB is the only hotel (as per the staff there) which has bugalow style rooms- instead of the ordinary attached rooms- This gave us a true tropical island feel. When you first arrive at the hotel it gives you the feeling of a secluded island where there is nothing but sun| relaxation| white sands and turquoise waters and it is indeed the case with TAB hotel.the gardens are just gorgeous| you can never get enough of them| they are everywhere and so beautifully taken care of| the bungalows look nice from outside but from inside they definitely need renovations| they are certainly not a 4+ star hotel rooms| but still they are ok if you are not planning to spend most of your time in the room.Food was amazing| we were on FB and the menu kept changing every evening for dinner. For lunch the menu was fixed at L'Oaisis retaurant. Breakfast and dinner were open buffet at Le Caravelle. Drinks were expensive.Staff were so friendly and smiling always| eager to help| room service was very goodWater sports are fun| we tried parasailing and scuba diving and we liked it a lot. Beach was just beautiful| clean| turquoise waters although a bit cold for us( we come from Dubai so we are used to warmer waters)The weather was sunny most of the times in the west| but it was cloudy in the east on the day we went to Ile Aux Cerfs island.The hotel was surprisingly crowded| we saw many guests in there| at times| there were no available tables for dinner at the restaurant. Night entertainment was ok but not great.The location of the hotel is very convenient| the bus stop and the taxi stand are just outside the hotel| the police station on the corner and the nearest supermarket about a 15 mins walking from the hotel. the hotel is 10 mins away from grand bay and around 15-20 mins away from Port Lois depending on the traffic. Overall TAB is a nice hotel and you will like it if you are not looking for a luxurious stay| we liked it so much because we were looking for a nice tropical hotel with great beach| nice food and excellent service and convenient location and we will definitely visit it after the renovations.,UAE,21-08-08,No,4
my dream wedding,We chose to go to mauritius for our wedding and honeymoon. we loved the idea of having beach front accommodation and the travel agents said that trou aux biche had the best beach on the island. we were not disappointed. yes| the resort is not new and funky but it is clean and has good facilities and a beautiful white sand beach. What made our holiday was the staff there| they are so helpful and friendly. Our wedding was beyond what I could have imagined| the wedding co-ordinator and the guest representative were amazing| they relieved all the stress of planning a wedding by guiding me through the process and they catered for our every need ( they even made sure my husband looked tidy and put his button hole on for him). We would not hear a bad word against the hotel or their staff. We look forward to going back for a wedding anniversary in the coming years. we did hear when we were there though that they are closing for renovation| and it sounds like it will be very plush when it is done.,newcastle| uk,25-06-08,No,5
Great place for a honeymoon,We spent the first five days of our honeymoon here and it was bliss! We stayed in a ocean view room which was above ground and had a private balcony. We had glimpses of the ocean through the palm trees. It only took a few seconds to walk to the beach.Inside the room it was clean| comfortable and had everything we needed. The beach was beautiful and there were heaps of sunbeds and shade provided. The beach was so clean| no seaweed or rubbish. The water was crystal clear and we only had to walk a few metres out and we could paddle around. However the hawkers were so annoying - but there isn't much the hotel can do. Just practice saying no and ignore them if your interested. With regard to food - we ate and ate - it was great. The waiters were so kind and couldn't have done more for us. Very helpful and attentive. All the meals we had were fresh and very tasty.Overall we had a wonderful time here| would go back in a heart beat!Enjoy!,Brisbane| Australia,16-05-08,No,5
Outstanding location| staff and experience,I have never felt the need to write a review before but our stay at the Trou aux Biches (TAB) is worthy of more than just a mention.We stayed here in Sept 2007| with family and friends| to celebrate our wedding. We had 28 guests| of which 9 were staying with us at TAB.The TAB is fantastic if you prefer more natural surroundings rather than just a big generic 4+ star hotel. It has numerous bungalow style villas dotted around extensive gardens. This was one of the reasons we chose to have our wedding here. It really is beautiful. One other reason is it is reputed to have one of the nicest beaches on the island. Having stayed the 2nd week at the Dinarobin I have to agree that it did have less coral and more sand so you could walk barefoot easily.Our wedding day itself was incredible and the staff could not have done enough for us and our guests. Fatima (commercial exec)| Christine (wedding co-ord) & Sanjay (Food & Bev manager) exceeded all our expectations and really made every effort to make the day perfect. They also truely know what they are doing so| if you are planning on getting married there| although nerve wrecking you can trust them to sort everything out once you arrive. We literally planned everything in 4 days and I would not have changed a thing. I must also add their service was above expectation throughout our stay and they consistently went out of their way to make us feel special and our whole stay truely memorable. Nothing was ever too much for them and they provided everything we wanted and more!Another great part about the TAB is the food which is out of this world. There truely is something for everyone. Usually when I book and experience half board buffets I am not filled with a great amount of expectation. At the TAB the food is freshly prepared| delicious and in abundance. No two days are the same and you are likely to struggle to get bored with what is on offer. It is definitely the best half board dinner buffet I have ever experienced to date.Some previous reviewers have commented on the cost of drinks in the hotel which are expensive. However| as mentioned| there is a supermarket 10 mins walk from the TAB where you can stock up on any alcohol you need which is a good idea.I note some of the negative reviews which have been given previously and I think it comes down to what you need or want from the hotel. If having a brand new| ultra modern room with 5*bathroom suites etc is important to you then this may not be the hotel to stay at. I know it is closing down for 18 months to have a complete refurbishment from around May 2008 so| perhaps| best to go after this is complete as I am sure it will then have the usual 4+ star fittings.The rooms were very clean| comfortable with fresh towels given every day and| for us| this is all we needed - we weren't in the rooms long enough to need anything else.If service| setting| food and location is key to your holiday enjoyment then the TAB is definitely one to consider.One last thing I wanted to mention is with respect to the bugs that will find their way into your room. Mauritius is a tropical island and| therefore| bugs are an unfortunate downside. If you really can't stand them and they will literally ruin your whole holiday then avoid the tropics (or any particularly hot/humid climate) on the whole. This is not something negative about the TAB only. In fact the Dinarobin| which is classified in a higher category| had many more bugs in their rooms than the TAB!I very much look forward to going back to the TAB and have no hesitation recommending it.,London,05-11-07,No,5
Avoid this hotel!,In February 2007| I began to contact Troux aux Biches hotel with the aim of booking a 4 night stay during my honeymoon. On the 19th February 2007| I received an email from Anishta confirming the following: 'Kindly note that honeymoon gifts like 2 t-shirts| a small bottle of champagne and fruits in room upon arrival will be offered' Following emails with Anishta| I agreed to book a superior room for 4 nights at a cost of €480 per night and paid 25% deposit ( cost of 1 night). What we found upon our arrival is detailed below: Check in:  We arrived on the 11.10.2007 and were greeted by a young man who spoke little english and little french ( I am fluent in both| so can 100% confirm language problems!). We were kept waiting in reception for 15 mins. Room: Upon arrival into the room we noticed the following: - No t shirts - No Champagne - Mouldy Pineapple wrapped in cling film - paint peeling off the walls - dusty - 2 small blood stains on the bed sheet - Old| plastic shower curtain - Bathroom filled with lizards and animals during the night.  Later| we informed reception that we would like to check out earlier than planned and they confirmed they would let us know how to best do this. We did NOT hear back from them so decided to check out anyway and emailed Anistha that very evening after dinner. Dinner: I am most grateful that the chef had been informed of my allergies| but what is the point of asking me what I want to eat when I am then presented with something else? Chef: ' What would you like to eat tonight? We have chicken| beef and fish. Me: ' Hmm| Chicken and fish please'. I was then given beef and chicken( beef was tough and felt re-heated). Manager greets me and says ' I am glad you have decided not to leave hotel| reception has just told me' ( obviously same guy who was due to call us back and who does not understand english or french) Breakfast: This was a JOKE! Croissants the size of eggs| hard bread and bird faeces ALL over the serving dishes and nets. CONCLUSION There was NOTHING superior about the room or hotel. We spent 11 days in Mauritius and ALL the hotels we stayed in were excellent. 4 nights in Le Preskil: Great value and service at 280 per night 4 Nights in Beau Rivage: Fantastic hotel for €560 euros per night...superior.....excellent.....fab!Have contacted hotel directly and they are refusing to give a refund....eventhough we only stayed 1 night.,Europe,19-10-07,No,1
Getting tired and slightly run down,An average place with friendly staff but a lack of attention to detail which spoiled the week.One of the first hotels on Mauritius| it's starting to show its age. Golf club not at all friendly and the 'a la carte' restaurant really not interested in providing a service.A long way from the airport and the beach is open to the public which means that someone is trying to sell you something every 5 minutes.Watersports OK.,London| United Kingdom,15-09-07,No,3
Lovely hotel| but young couples beware!,We chose the Trou Aux Biches hotel for our honeymoon because| although it is a hotel| all the rooms are situated in bungalows that are scattered amongst palm trees. The hotel is closing in May 2008 for 18 months for a complete refurbishment| therefore it's safe to assume that once re-opened| it will be much improved. Also| it may be the case that some of my comments will be dated once the hotel reopens. Please be aware that the existing golf course across the road is being sold to developers| presumably to finance the refurb.The location is superb| and the whole complex has a wonderful feel about it as you walk around. We found the staff very friendly and always willing to help; one night we enquired about one of the starters| and the next night we were handed an envelope with a printed receipe!The beach is excellent| however somewhat spoilt by the excessive number of boats engaged in all the water sport activities. Mon Choisy beach| just up the road is much more the tropical beach paradise| much quieter and more relaxing. Hawkers are something you just have to get used to - best to try and avoid getting involved in a conversation| otherwise it's harder to get rid of them.I would certainly recommend going for a beachfront bungalow. I would imagine the noise from the main road would be an issue if you are located a distance from the beach. We stayed in a standard room close to the Oasis bar| which is an excellent location for the beach/pool/restaurant and water sports. Having an upstairs room also gives the bonus of having a vaulted ceiling. Whilst the rooms are a little dated| they are tastefully decorated and kept very clean. Beach towels are provided and replaced with fresh ones every evening. For the boys| you can get live Premiership on the TV in the room! For light sleepers| some ear plugs would be useful because the birds start making a racket at sunrise.For us| the food was one of the highlights of our stay. There are three restaurants: the Caravelle is a fantastic buffet with foods from around the world - very hard to avoid piling your plate with as much as you can; the Oasis which is a more romantic experience; and L'Espladon| on the beach. At the last two| the hotel is keen for you to 'upgrade' from your half board menu to an A La Carte menu. I found the half board menu at Oasis perfectly adequate and only tried the A La Carte once. At L'Espladon| twice a week you are invited to spend £40 each extra to eat lobster or speciality seafood. Not worth it in my opinion.As expected| the drinks were expensive; I'm not sure why Beachcomber have decided not to make this an all-inclusive hotel. The cheapest bottle of wine is over £25; we soon started opting for a glass of house wine with our meal (although you can't buy this by the bottle). Beer is priced ok| spirits/mixer will set you back £5-6| cocktails similar. The mini bar in the rooms is also expensive| however thanks to a previous reviewer| we made a few trips to the supermarket down the road (right at main entrance| 5-10 min walk) which sells all the same soft drinks and beer. The mini bar is checked daily| but not a problem if you keep replacing what you take out! I recommend buying some Pimms at duty free| because a Pimms & Sprite on the beach at sunset is a perfect end to the day!The activities that are available at the hotel are superb - we found ourselves doing something most days morning & afternoon. Water skiing is certainly the most popular and can get quite busy| so best to get there at the start of each session (10.00 & 2.00). Some water sports are not operated by the hotel| eg parasailing| so you have to pay for these. The tennis facilities are excellent and are floodlit. No need to take your own rackets| these are provided free| but take your own tennis balls if you can| because the hotel makes you buy a tube of balls.Not a great deal on the island in terms of tourist attractions| however we really enjoyed our visit to Adventure du Sucre| which is an interactive sugar museum based at a factory that closed down quite recently. It also provides a lot of information on the history of the island| something which we weren't aware of beforehand| so an added bonus. The restaurant opposite the museum serves a very good lunch (go for the Creole sausages and chilli). Close by the museum is the botanic gardens. OK| as gardens go| however the Amazonian lilies were looking quite poorly (due to the weather according to the notice by the pond).Elsewhere| the coloured earths in the south of the island are worth seeing| albeit a bit of a drive. Couple this with lunch at Vasconde sur Monde| a lovely hillside restaurant with great views. We also did the catamaran cruise| which involved seeing dolphins| snorkelling| beach visit and lunch on the boat. Well worth doing| because the crew on the boat are very funny.Notwithstanding all the positive comments made above| there were a few downsides to our 2 week stay. Not much we could do about the weather| but there were a lot of cloudy days and the wind can be quite brisk. When the sun comes out| it's very warm (25C+) and getting a suntan wasn't a problem. At this time of year| please be prepared for a bit of a chill in the evening| especially if you want to sit outside at the Oasis restuarant. Evening entertainment - in a word| crap. Not sure if it's the same throughout the year| but during our stay it was nothing more than mediocre live bands| playing songs from yesteryear. When we asked Fatima| the hotel manager| if it was possible to visit other local Beachcomber hotels in the evening for a change of scene| we got a funny look as though she was shocked that we weren't satisfied. After a week| we got talking to one of the staff| who advised we go to Grand Baie. This was a great night - go to the Banana Cafe on a Fri or Sat night as they have live music. The band we saw were out of this world. We didn't make it to the Buddha Bar| but this also has a fairly good reputation. Grand Baie by day was disappointing and didn't live up to expectations - not the chic sailing resort that the guide books make it out to be| however the hotels are supposed to be excellent.We envisaged the hotel would be full of English couples| a lot of which would be on honeymoon. This| however| was not the case. The hotel was dominated by the French| not a problem in itself but this made it very difficult to meet others to have a drink with in the evening. Although on honeymoon| we were looking forward to meeting other people so that we weren't in each other's company all the time. Only once did we spot another English couple without children. We asked one of the waiters who we befriended if he knew of other English couples on honeymoon - I think it was a case of 'lost in translation' as we ended up giving him the impression that we were swingers! There are also a lot of families here| again this wasn't a problem for us| but could be for others. The kids club did appear to be excellent and popular| so there weren't children running around all day. Overall| a great place with plenty to do during the day| but the evenings were disappointing.,Cambridge,01-09-07,No,4
Absolutely Perfect,We got married at the Trou aux Biches on the 31st May and it was everything and more than we wished for.We could not believe that the hotel is about to have a full refurb because it still looked like new to us! It was so clean and the rooms were so spacious and they certainly were not dated!! The food was lovely with a large choice and the choice of 3 restaurants although one (fish restaurant on the beach) was at a supplement| which we did try twice but thought it was a little expensive when we had already paid for half board| but it obviously didnt put us off. All the staff were friendly| polite and so so helpful (if you needed it) we could not have wished for more. Nothing was too much trouble. Our rooms were cleaned every day and even at night the night porter came with clean beach towelsand a mosquito tablet for the plug that was provided by the hotel!The Beach was clean| the sea was blue and yes there were the beach sellers but you just said no thank you and they were on their way - infact there were one or two which were characters especially Madonna and the guy with the flower hat!The wedding team especially Christal| were extremely helpful and helped us organise our wedding that went without any hitches - absolutely perfect!,West Yorkshire,11-08-07,No,5
Old and Dated,Stayed at the Trou aux Biches Hotel for 2 weeks in June 2007.Had previously stayed at the Maritim Hotel 2 years earlier after doing a South African Safari.Wished we had gone back to the Maritim.The Trou aux Biches Hotel is very old and tired looking. The drinks we found very expensive especially after the AI at the Maritim Hotel| food was o.k. nothing special. We were disappointed with the beach as it was dirty with litter and the sunbeds looked like they needed a good scrub (that's if you could find one that wasn't broken). There seemed a lot of children on the resort| which we weren't expecting. Most of the staff were friendly a few at the bars were pretty miserable.We would not stay at this hotel again. I have heard it is going to be closed soon and rebuilt across the road on the golf course.,Newport,31-07-07,No,2
Stunning hotel on one of Mauritius' best beaches,I have just come back from staying at this hotel with my parents| brother and 8 year old daughter Anya. The hotel was fantastic for all of us with a real air of elegance and mauritian charm. All the staff are very friendly and warm and the evening meal buffet was delicious. There is always a pasta dish or a european dish served alongside traditional Mauritian fish| chicken or beef dishes. Everyone in my family enjoyed the ambience and the food. My daughter tried kids waterskiing which is fantastic for young children and free via the kids club. She only went to the kids club for the afternoon but all kids get a free rucksack and t-shirt- so its worth registering just for this! It is also worth trying the daily free glass bottom boat tour from the hotel jetty. At the end of this jetty is a great restaurant on the beach to have lunch open until 2.30pm. They do a good kids menu and is the most fabulous place to have lunch whilst being on the sand overlooking turquoise waters! The water is so calm that children are so safe to paddle and build sand castles without worrying about any waves! A big tip is to change any money at the Shibani foreign exchange shop which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel ( turn left when exiting the hotel) opposite the Mauritian Commercial bank just before Mont Choisy. The exchange rates is great- about 62 rupees to the GBP whereas the hotels and other banks only offer 58. I would strongly recommend this hotel. Its wonderful and i have visited many 5 star hotels around the world- Royal Meridien Dubai| Sandy Lane Barbados etc...,london,29-07-07,No,5
Totally agree with the previous post,Actually I don't have anything to add to the previous review. We stayed in Trou Aux Biches for 2 weeks in June 2007 wit 2 children (7 and 13 y.o.)Absolutely wonderfull stay - weather| family appartments| ocean| food| service... And the feeling of absolute security! Spent 2 days driving around the island - very nice! Had catamaran trip| deep see fishing| submarine dive| a lot of snorkeling| tennis etc.Highly recommend. The only point - the hotel will be closed in April 2008 for 2 years for the full reconstruction.,Moscow,22-07-07,No,5
We are going back this year!,We stayed at the Trou aux Biches last year| with our 3 children aged 2| 6 and 8. We had a familty apartment| and I can honestly say that EVERYTHING was wonderful!The kids all loved the food (not nuggets and chips every night as I had feared| but fab and varied food in the kids buffet. And they ate from our buffet too - which was also tasty and varied.The staff were friendly and attentive| there if you needed anything| yet not overbearing.The beach is to die for - wonderful safe sea| whitest of white talcum powder sand and beautiful sunsets too on this part of the island. If you can| take buckets and spades with you as they seemed few and far between out there. A nice French man gave us his lilo| which we passed on at the end of our stay| gold dust! Snorkels| too are a good idea to take as the water is warm and shallow| and perfect for children to mess about with and get a good look at the fish.We had to try out the medical centre as our son had a bad ear infection| and boy| were we pleased there is one on site - friendly| English speaking and right on the ball.The nurse had to call in a doctor from the local hospital for anti biotics| and he came when he said he would| and visited us the next day to make sure all was well.The apartment was spacious and clean| and only a few footsteps accross grass to the beach. Faultlessly upkept during our stay too. Though we were taken aback on the first evening when the porter came in to turn back the sheets| switch on the side lights| replace the towels and sweep away any sand from the floor! The night 'watch' was doing his job| too| when he knocked on our door late one evening to tell us we'd left our keys on the outside.We felt very comfortable and looked after the whole time. A nice feeling when you are a long way from home with young children!!If you are after a relaxing family holiday - in paradise| with the knowledge that your young children will be happy and safe(whether or not you use the mini club-we didn't as our youngest was just 2) this is the place for you. In fact we are going back in 3 weeks time!That says it all really. Ignore all bad reports - go for it!,Surrey| England,08-04-07,No,5
Great Place to stay!,My boyfriend and I spent the 1st week of December 2006 at the Trou aux Biches Hotel.The place had been suggested to us by our TUI travel agency in Zurich since we wanted something not modern but charateristich and with a beautiful beach. We believe this choice has really satisfied us a lot. The bungalows are all nice and quite big| teh beach is absolutely fantastic and we also found that the 3 restaurants were quite good according to quality/price. We also were able of doing lots of water activities all included in the price. Also teh hotel staff helped me organizing my boyfriend's birthday party- I had booked 1 month before going what they had suggested to me woudl have been a nice surprice: a private dinner on the T-Jetty of the hotel with a complimentary cake. The dinner went very well and it was so romantic! Probably teh only bad thing i have to say was that during the day in front of teh beach there are too many little boats and sometimes in teh afternoon teh water was not as clean as in the morning but we also understand that this is done to recreate the tourists.In any case i strongly recommend thsi hotel,Zurich,04-04-07,No,4
Guaranty for a great time!,We went to this hotel for a week in May 2005. I guess May is not the best time to go but we did not know that at the time| but overall we had great weather with a little bit of rain a couple of days.The hotel is al open air with beautiful gardens and an amazing beach!!The rooms where very nice| we stayed in one of the suitesthat were situated in two levels and were very happy with it.it had a balcony on the first floor with a view of the sunset which was great!Apart form that| the rooms were spacious|big comfortable bed| nice bathroom.I personally didnt find them unique in any way or particulary atmospheric but overall we were very satisfied!I loved the food!!!Everything ith ate was excellent and the lobster night on the beach was just awesome!!!Do not miss that out!Staff very friendly.It was aplasure to meet them all really they were that nice!The only con is the limited night life.But apart form that a great experience!Highly recommend it!,London,13-02-07,No,4
Paradise!!,The Trou aux Biches hotel is in a word 'beautiful'! We stayed there for 10 days in June 2006 and got married there. Because of our wedding we did upgrade to one of the three 2 floor suites which I imagine most people won't be doing when visiting here but all of our guests stayed in the standard rooms and these were great. All were situated in little villas which have 3 to 4 rooms in each spread out in truly beautiful gardens (this makes it feel like paradise). The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated in total our party took up 1 suite and 6 rooms of these only one room had a problem with some ants that got into some food but this all got sorted out within a day or two and was not a major problem. The main restaurant where we had breakfast and dinner on most nights was really good. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choice and there would be different themed buffets in the evening. We really enjoyed these although if you have really really fussy kids the choice may be limited although there was always some form of pasta or something that they could eat. The desserts were fantastic aswell with a lot of selection (I am suprised I still fitted into my wedding dress!). In terms of facilites the hotel had to offer there were quite a few. There is a kids club that is supposed to be very good| the kids in our party did go for a couple of days and enjoyed it althouh there did not seem to be that many children there with staff desperate to encourage passing children in so they had children to play with it seemed! - I think this was because we went in low season (Mauritius winter). All the sports are free which was great we had a go at waterskiing| boules| table tennis went out on a pedalo| on the glass bottom boat and snorkelling at the edge of the reef all for free it was great!!! The beach is really nice although you will get hassaled by beach sellers - a firm 'no thankyou' every time works a treat.As for our wedding - it was perfect| the staff made it the best day of our lives with a beautiful setting| harpist playing in the background to set the mood and well qualified photographers etc to ensure we had memories for years to come- I cannot fault them at all!And for the weather..... well it was June which as I said before is winter in Mauritius| the first five days were perfect (our wedding was on the fifth day!!!) around 25-27 degrees with sunshine all the way but the day after the wedding it turned colder and windy it wasn't really bad or anything but not perfect and I did feel for the people who got married on those days after the weather had been so perfect on ours. I think there was a monsoon in India at the time which gave Mauritius a bit of wind but like I said before nothing major and we still had a great time.The hotel is at one of the furthest points from the airport it takes just under an hour by transfer. You will read that many of the Mauritian people live in poor housing with conditions that we do not find in England and that we would consider poverty. It is true that when you drive through these villages to your big expensive luxury hotel it doesn't seem fair but I think it pays to remember that tourism is a big industry for Mauritius and by paying to go there you are providing its citizens with jobs. Apparently working for Beachcomber is considered highly and staff were very proud to work for them. When we went out for the day to visit places we used taxis. Its all very weird when you are used to taxis in England. You get a price for a return fare| they take you to your destination and then wait for you even if you are there for hours| you then pay them when you get dropped back!! My only one fault of the taxis were those used when we out in Grand Baie to the pubs and clubs after 9pm they drove very fast round some bendy roads but all those in the day were fine. We visited the Casela bird park| Port Louis| Grand Baie and Le waterpark.All in all a great hotel| you can see why it has such a large number of returning holidaymakers| I would certainly go again and I hope this review has been useful!,England,30-12-06,No,5
Excellent Holiday,We spent 10 nights in Trou Au Biches and it was really fantastic. The Beach was just beautiful and just a few steps from our doorstep. We stayed in a superior room which had everything we needed. The only criticism I would have of our accommodation is that it wasnt beach facing. It was at the side of the resort beside a public park which was a little noisy on a saturday night.Food was great ! The evening buffet was really good| loads of variety and really good quality food. I can be prone to stomach upset and I never had one problem here. Staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke english. Drinks were a bit expensive especially wine. Overall it is an ideal honeymoon location to chill out and enjoy the beautiful setting.,Leitrim| Ireland,27-11-06,No,4
Bloody Good !!!!,We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights for the first leg of our honeymoon| and let me tell you we wish we could of stayed the whole 14 nights. This place is amazing| everything you can imagine is attended to by this super friendly hotel| nothing is too much for the staff here and they go out of their way to make you feel as comfortable as possible. The food here is quite exquisite| and if you have the chance to dine on the beach for the seafood buffet| put it on top of your priority list.......sweet lobsters| crab| dorado fish only to name a few| BBQ fresh as you wait....simply superb. The golf course accross the road offers only 9 small holes that would not test the good players| but then again we are not all pro's are we !!!!!!! The hotel is located not far from Port Louis and Grande Baie| so location is ideal. The only downside is the lack of late night activities for the younger generation| so those willing to dance and drink into the wee hours of the morning| this hotel is not for you. Overall| a great place to stay and recharge the batteries| and ideal for kids as well.,Sydney| Australia,29-10-06,No,5
Great location!,My wife and I| having stayed previously at the Shandrani| wished to take a break at a west coast hotel with a good beach.And we got what we wanted!The Trou aux Biches hotel has lodges spread around the grounds| not high density. The beach is white coral| room for everyone on loungers. Water is deep enough to swim in| and no coral to cut feet on! There are water sports available| and as a previous reviewer has stated| they are not a nusiance| in fact an intersting diversion.Staff were very good| perhaps not as efficient as the Shandrani. Rooms were spacious (Beach front superior)| and there was late night noise from the entertainment- perhaps the Trou aux Biches could copy the Shandrani and have the music only two or three times a week.Food was very good- no disappointments. Wine was priced as in a European restaurant.Overall| a very relaxing holiday in a teriffic location!,Cirencester| United Kingdom,29-10-06,No,4
Friendly and laid back,I stayed at the Trou aux Biches Hotel with the whole family for a family wedding at the Legends hotel and found it a very friendly and relaxing hotel - much more personal than the larger| brasher Legends.We had a family apartment which gave plantly of space for our two young children; the only slight complaint would be that we were close to the bar where the evening entertainment could be quite loud after the childrens' bed time! Although the area covered by the hotel is quite extensive| it never seemed crowded| and finding sunbeds and tables at meal times was never a problem. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive| and bent over backwards to resolve any problems quickly and efficiently.The beach is beautiful - perfect for children| with plently to see and do.The childrens club provided by the hotel is EXCELLENT - our 5 year old was waterskiing| fishing from a boat on the reef| playing golf| taking boat trips and having dressing up parties for the whole 2 weeks we were there. And babysitters are available for a tiny fee so children under 3 can also attend the club.Overall| this is a laid back and relaxing place to stay| whether you are honeymooning or building sandcastles with the children!,England,18-10-06,No,5
Beautiful Hotel,We just got back from our Honeymoon to the Seychelles (Acajou Hotel| Praslin)| and Mauritius (Trou Aux Biches Hotel and Le Paradis). It has been great!! We stayed 5 nights in a superior room in the Trou aux Biches Hotel (you should book a superior room| they are much| much larger than the standard rooms!!) and the room (which was not old-fashioned at all)| the hotel| the staff and the restaurants are great!! I cannot understand why the the traveller from Isle of Man wrote that the buffets are 'below standard'| because there was a lot of choice from the buffets| what more do you need for breakfast than: pancakes| all the stuff for the English Breakfast| eggs (omelets and boiled eggs)| cheese| ham| marmelade| croissants| toast| baguettes| pain au chocalat| etc| etc.?? And also the dinner buffets where great! They change every night| and you should see the choice of desserts!! It is true that the speedboats are close to the beach (but they don't come into the bathing area!)| but it is nice that you can look at something in the water| otherwise it will get (maybe) a bit dull? If you are looking for a quiet place| than you should go to the Seychelles| but please note that the buffets in the hotels there are not as luxury as in the Trou aux Biches Hotel!! We also had dinner in L'Oasis restaurant| which was superb! There is a choice menu which is included in the halfboard| and you can have an a la carte dinner| both are great! It is almost haute cuisine!! The gardens of the hotel are very beatiful and I did not find that the entertainment was only for the French tourists| they do everything in French and in English!! The beach is small| but attractive and yes there are beachhawkers| but it is nice to talk to them! The sea was almost like a lake| the water was very quiet and clear.We have also been to the Paradis hotel| which is more luxury| in the meaning of: more restaurants| the reception area is very luxury and the staff is trained to do more for you than you expect.Both hotels are great honeymoon hotels!!If you have any questions about the Trou aux Biches hotel| please contact me.Greetings| Mascha,The Netherlands,15-10-06,No,5
Disappointing,We were disappointed with several aspects of the hotel. The first affects all Mauritius and that is the proximity of speed boats to the bathing areas. There are roped off areas for swimming which unfortunately are not always respected by the boat operators. In the case of Trou aux Biches the speed boats are no more than 50-70m from the beach and the swimming area is very limited. The hotel rooms at Trou aux Biches were tired looking and despite notifying reception that our children's room door was so badly warped that it was impossible for them to lock | it was not fixed by the time we changed hotels 2 days later. The food at breakfast and the buffet meals were also below standard and the choice was limited.We changed hotels to the Shandrani| another hotel in the the Beachcomber group and were impressed on all fronts: The rooms were much larger and better maintained| the choice and quality of the food was a vast improvement on the Trou aux Biches and the roped off areas for swimming were much larger and we were able to snorkel in amongst patches of coral within the swimming areas.,Isle of Man,09-10-06,No,1
Little piece of paradise,"The hotel is situated on a little piece of paradise and the staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. Yes| the hotel is probably more geared towards the French tourist| but more so because the locals speak better French than English. But they all speak English too and you will have no problem communicating with any of them. As for the hotel. The gardens| the setting and the beach are just too beautiful for words. A very romantic setting and the perfect hotel for anybody wishing to have the proper tropical beach experience. The hotel rooms could do with a re-furbishment. The decor is outdated but not completely unacceptable. It still reminds one of a beach holiday. And besides that| nobody should spend too much time in their room in any case. Mauritius is a destination for people wishing to be in the water and out and about during the day. The rooms are nevertheless comfortable and the setting of the chalets beneath the palms and in very close proximity to the beach provides for the perfect island experience. Older people should book a room in the lower section of the chalets as the staircase leading up to the upper room can be steep.The food is also excellent but it can be repetitive if you are on a half board basis. If you have some extra cash to spend| I would recommend the full board option as there are 3 restaurants to choose from and the other two have a very good menu. There are however local restaurants just outside the hotel that you can go to. And Grand Baie is only 5 minutes away by bus with many restaurants offering affordable and tasty dishes.The beach is plain beautiful. Definately the best in this area.The Trou Aux Biches Hotel can only disappoint those that are generally negative towards everything and people that will always find a reason to complain about anything and everything. I personally think that you can not go wrong staying here. The hotel is excellent| the setting is the best in the entire area| if not on the island and I only saw happy and extremely content people in the hotel. The beach hawkers are also no problem at all. I loved the fact that locals are still allowed to use the beach for selling their items. It is their island after all and one friendly ""no thank you"" was enough to keep them away if you did not want to buy something from them. You can however also engage in a friendly conversation with them in order to learn about general island life| the people and their problems. I loved the fact that you're not staying in an enclave that is for tourists only.This hotel's recipe for success is definately working well for them. It is efficient| friendly| beautiful and I for sure would love to go back again.",South Africa,05-10-06,No,5
A most magical wedding and honeymoon,My new husband and I have just returned from our two week stay at the Trou Aux Biches Hotel| Mauritius. It was the best holiday of our lives.We arrived 17th Setember 2006 to be greeted by the PR guest relations manager and a cocktail. I was slightly apprehensive of getting married abroad especially as my friends and family would not be there.However| it really didn't matter. The staff couldn't do enough for us| everyone was so friendly| professional and curtious. Our experience of all Mauritians outside the hotel was the same.The hotel is on the North West coast of Mauritius with the best beach on the island. It also has better weather than most of the island because it is a more sheltered location than the East coast and better than the South West as it is well away from the airport! Trou Aux Biches hotel has number of white 'bungalows' dotted along the beach and three restaurants. The 'bunaglows' are divided usually into three types of accommodation. Although one of the bigger hotels on the island you really don't realise its size as staying in the bungalow gives a more intimate feeling. Apparently the hotel was full but we didn't realise.The hotel is one of the older hotels on the island although it really doesn't feel outdated. We found all rooms to be fresh| bright and impeccably clean| with en-suite bathrooms and doors opening on to beautifully manicured gardens| and the beach! It felt rather like a James Bond movie.A number of other hotels almost pursuaded us to book with them because of their 'boutique' decore (probably to counteract the fact that their beaches aren't as good). However| we were pursuaded by the beach at Trou aux Biches. We also realise now these would probably have been overpriced. The drinks are quite expensive but we would recommend you stock up on drinks from the local supermarket (Popo) which is about 10mins walking distance from the entrance of the hotel. Our wedding day was amazing. My husband was given another room to change in whilst I went and had my hair done. The hairdressers were brilliant. At first I was worried that my usual hairdresser wouldn't be doing my hair| but it really didn't matter I worked with the hairdresser and chose one that suited me. She in fact said ' I try never to do the same hair style twice'. As she does weddings all the time she was truly expertised and probably gave me a better style than my regular hairdresser. I had a manicure too| and could have had my makeup done with her but chose not to as I like to do my own. Meanwhile my husband was having a settler at the bar. The florist who I met a few days before to choose flowers gave us the most amazing array. I would recommend a videographer as well as a photographer - to show folks back home! The photos are beautiful| the video is slightly cheesy but it is a wonderful reminder of the most wonderful day.All the fomalities were signed a couple of days before (again all organised for us) and we said our own vows to each other on the beach surrounded by palm trees. We then walked down to the Catermeran to have a sail and some photos to watch the sunset with some champagne. After sailing back we had a beautiful meal on the Jetty - true heaven.Only one wedding is allowed at the hotel per day| and because of that we were made to feel truly special. The hotel is organising these all the time and they did a much better job than I could have done with a full time job. Truly magical.The swimming pool was great too adjacent to the bar and the water sports were great although the water skiing did tend to get a bit crowded.There are beach 'hawkers' that have licences to sell their wears on the beach as there are everywhere in every country. However| if you just say 'non merci' they will leave you alone.The weather was mixed we had some really hot days and some rain| but we still have good tans. To be fair it would have been too hot to have sun every day and the rain was a light relief and didn't last long! The best time to go is apparently October and May. December is there summer but average temps are around 34 degrees and 90% humidity - possibly too hot!We cycled Grand Bay the local town nearby - great for cheap clothes as there are a number of well known lables made on the island. We also visited the Port Louis market - a true must to experience a local market. Everyone was so friendly| I would recommend making friends with a local taxi driver and book him directly as going through the tour company can triple the price!The food was delicious - especially the fish for obvious reasons and I would highly recommend the fish restaurant at the hotel - located on the beach it is definitely the most romantic.All I can say is that the hotel| the staff| the Mauritians| the island made for a most romantic and beautiful time. One which my husband and I will never forget. If you would like to contact me for further information about our experience please e-mail at barnescamilla@hotmail.com,Cheshire,03-10-06,No,5
I loved this hotel!!,On the 16th of January 2004| my husband and I got married at the Trou aux Biches Hotel. We were very nervous when we arrived as we are both very fussy people | there are a lot of things we look for that makes us feel we have arrived at the write place. From all the reviews we read| we knew that this hotel has one of the most beautiful beaches in Mauritius| so| we were really sold on that. We needed the ideal beach to have our wedding on. We also like a place with a sense of “modern” style| modern construction| modern furnishings etc….. If this is what you are looking for… than Trou aux Biches Hotel is not the place for you| the hotel has been around for many years| if I’m not mistaken I think it was one of the first hotels that were built northwest of Mauritius. So| my husband and I were disappointed at first glance. But| once we received our welcoming cocktails we were overwhelmed by the hospitality of the staff| the tranquil gardens and fine service. The Trou aux Biches Hotel staff really makes you feel welcome by acknowledging us by our surname. Our wedding coordinator was really great at organizing EVERYTHING| we eventually decided to get married at sea on a catermarange – man| that was amazing!! We ended off our special day with a romantic dinner for two on the jetty that the Trou aux Biches Hotel staff lit with candles all the way to our table. Our waiter| waited halfway down the jetty and would attend to us when summons| he would leave us to it and would have stayed there even if we stayed on the jetty until sunrise. It was the most romantic dinner I ever had. The food was amazing and our plate was always over flowing. Thank you Trou aux Biches Hotel for making our Wedding Day and Honeymoon at your Hotel such a memorable one. My husband and I will be returning on the 28th September 2006 – 5th of October 2006| and although for not such a special occasion| I’m eager to see if the staff| service| and cleanliness is of the same caliber as in 2004.,Gauteng (Jozi),15-09-06,No,4
Excellent hotel| friendly staff| beautiful beach| Nice rooms,I booked this hotel through their beachcomber website since i got a good honeymoon discount. I was offered room no 125 which was away from the restaurant crowd and it was sea facing. The room was neat and clean and it was being cleaned 2 times in a day. the resort has 2 hotels. the menu looks to be repeating if you are on a half board. if you can pay some extra money you can get a good variety. International calls are very expensive. I would advise you to buy a phone card from grand baie which is a few minutes from the hotel.Lot of water sports are free and are never crowded and bookings are not needed.I rented a car from the airport and drove all the way to the hotel| the directions are pretty straightforward and if you ever get lost| you can always ask someone on the road. i would advice you to rent a car rather than having to do a taxi anytime you feel like going out.,USA,05-09-06,No,5
We loved it.,"We have just returned from a fabulous holiday there. We also spent time at le Cannonier. Our rooms were beautiful and well looked after by really friendly staff. In fact everywhere we went staff at both those hotels couldn't have done enough for us.The beach is stunning| no doubt about it and yes there are hawkers| but they are everywhere. Just say ""no thanks"" and they'll go. However| sometimes it is worth looking at their Tshirts etc as prices are good and bargains are there to be had. The Hotel food was outstanding| absolutely delicious. As for the hotel being more geared to the French| fine| practice your French. We didn't go there to bump into half of North London.",London,03-09-06,No,5
Don't Stay Here,Got married there. Awful experience. Cost 6k for two weeks which| given the cost| should have meant luxury. On arrival| was upgraded due to getting wed at resort - room was mouldy (they tell me to 'expect this' in such a climate) which is totally unexceptable. Never had mould problem before. Staff are extremely rude - my opinion is that they do not like the English - they say they do?? puzzling in itself as everything there is geared for the French including papers/shows etc. Anyway| my ignorance at not speaking fluent French I suppose! Thatching taking place whilst we were there which was very noisy and disruptive - not very romantic I must say. Drinks very overpriced and check your bill when you leave - you'll find extra's appearing on it. They even tell you to ask for a bill regularly| as we did| but still things 'appeared.' FOOD - absolutely wonderful - only thing good about TAB. Always fresh and plentiful with good selection. BEACHES - avoid. Constant harrassment by beach vendors SPOILT the 'barefoot romance.' This is probably the main reason I would not recommend this resort. ANNOYING being pested endlessly when your v. hot and bothered and not interested in their wears. PLEASE TAB| STOP THIS. When you pay all this money| you do not want bothering. YOU RUINED OUR WEDDING.,ENGLAND,28-08-06,No,1
Perfect Wedding,We got married at the Trou aux Biches on 7th June 06. All I can say is it was a fantastic experience from the minute we arrived. I was very anxious about the holiday with it being our wedding and honeymoon & I had read a few reviews about the hotel that weren't very favorable. We were also going on our own & were apprehensive about how we would feel not having any family around us on the day. When I read the review from Richard McCormack who got married there on 11th May| my mind was put at rest. All I can say is our wedding day was MORE ROMANTIC & PERFECT than I could have ever imagined it to be. The staff were all fantastic & unbelievably helpful & friendly. I really think that it is the most romantic resort ever & even though there were weddings on most days| you are really made to feel special on your wedding day. As soon as we arrived we were given an appointment with the wedding coordinator Christine| who just took care of everything for us. We had a romantic candlelit dinner for 2 on our wedding night on the jetty which was amazing. We did upgrade to a deluxe beach front room which was lovely| so I couldn't comment on the standard rooms. The weather in June is a little unpredictable| although never cold. The day before we got married it did rain quite a bit| but it was perfect for our day. The beach is beautiful white sand & the sunsets were out of this world. If I have any quibbles with the resort then it would be that the drinks were really expensive in the hotel.| although I have been told they are the same in all Mauritian resorts. We used to go to the local supermarket| buy the drinks that were in the mini bar so we could replace them. A lot cheaper. I have never had such wonderful food on holiday before. I had fish of the day for lunch everyday & sometimes fish for dinner it was amazing & even though my husband doen's eat fish his food was just as good. We did only stay for 1 week| because we moved to the Shandrani for the 2nd week| which again was superb hotel (with all inclusive)| recently refurbished rooms which were lovely| and a choice of 3 beaches. Our favorite was the wild beach with some big waves. The food was just as good as the Trou aux Biches. The weather there was a bit more unpredictable| because it was the south east of the island. I think if the Trou aux Biches was all inclusive or drinks were cheaper| we would have probably stayed longer. Also we didn't visit all the places we wanted to around the North of the island| but I'm glad we experienced different sides of the island. If you have any questions about either resorts please feel free to email me at fiona.baseley@btinternet.com. We have some great photos also.,Derby| England,05-07-06,No,5
perfect for cildren,I would really recommend this hotel for families with children. We visited trou aux biches with our 3 year old son last summer| and we really enjoyed our stay. The mini club is excellent| and they have a lot of activities for children of all ages. At the beginning| we were a bit sceptical to leave him alone at the mini club as the staff only speak french and englishf but after some days we were very confident in leaving him there. On his request| he ate dinner with the other kids every day| which gave us the opportunity to have some quiet| romantic dinners. A tip for those who travel with small children| is to ask for a room not to close to the main restaurant. This because the evening entartainment can be a bit loud.,Oslo| Norway,15-06-06,No,5
Married at Trou Aux Biches,"We got married on the 11th May and all I can say is that I totally agree with the last review. Everything at Trou Aux Biches is a little slice of Heaven| the rooms are superb| the grounds immaculate and it has the best beach on the Island. The staff were absolutely out of this world| they cater for all your needs and the word ""No"" is not in their vocabulary. I even got to watch the FA Cup final at one of the managers house after he meet us for a drink on his day off!! If you are genuine people who are looking for a superb holiday and either the wedding of your dreams or Honeymoon then this is the place. All the staff knew our names| we treated them with the same sincerity that they treated us and this truly makes your holiday very special. We even had two firework displays after speaking to the events manager Eric who was great. If you are looking for something a little quiet then the Oasis Bar is better than the La Caravelle which is buffet style but both are great| please say Hi to Vishnu| Menon and little Dave in the Oasis as these are very kind and special people. Sunsets to die for....I don't know how anyone can write a bad review| some people you cannot please. If you want luxury then Trou Aux Biches has it| if you want a Butlins abroad then go to Spain.If you would like to ask any questions then please contact me on richard.mccormack@eu.jll.com| I have some fantastic photos.",London,23-05-06,No,5
heaven and paradise rolled into one,We married here on may 5th 2006 what a beautiful place couldnt have wished for a nicer location.The bungalows were beautiful very clean the beaches fantastic| food sublime| staff all of them were truly fantastic we were known by name by even the cleaners. The staff bent over backwards for us making our wedding the most romantic day of our lives. I was apprehensive after reading some of your reviews befrore leaving to go to mauritius but all i can say is they are so wrong. Yes the drinks arent cheap but they are on par with uk prices what do you expect when your in paradise and its true you cant please everyone all of the time. To anyone booked to stay there or thinking of it| i promise you your going to paradise its a beautiful place with beautiful people. You would never get a wedding anywhere to match the wedding we had there. Even visiting port louis the day before our wedding meeting judges| lawyers etc they were so lovely and friendly not like officials in the u.k.The registrar was lovely really made our wedding so special. So anybody planning to go there look forward to it and savour every moment this place is paradise i wish we were still there. Anyone can contact me and il send them some pics of this paradise debs675@hotmail.com,Liverpool| United Kingdom,13-05-06,No,5
Dodgy staff| great rooms,We were married at Trou Aux Biches on Valentines Day. The room was amazing| the beach was quite nice and the grounds are spacious and pretty. The restaurants serve good food. The buffet is good but the lobster dinner which costs £40 each extra is poor.The staff were appauling. Room service closes at 6pm. Drinks are very expensive and we often ended up walking to the supermarket and buying our own wine as it was quicker than waiting for a waiter in the restaurants.On our wedding night we had to wait 2 hours with a party of 10 people to get a starter!All in all| I would say| go to the Seychelles. Same price but much better service. Also you do not have to do battle with the Mauritian immigration staff who are completely incomptetant| so you don't spend 1 1/2 hours after a long flight queuing for immigration.,London,14-03-06,No,2
paradise,we got married here| it was perfect and very romantic! superb beach and facilities to keep you occupied..food was excellent as were the (numerous) staff| simply paradise.,Cheshire| England,11-03-06,No,5
Fabulous Location and Facilities,I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights as a single business traveller and had a very nice stay there. The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable| and clean| if maybe in need of some redecoration and modernisation. The beach is beautiful| and there is also a nice pool area| with plenty of water sports offered including a good dive school. There was a good mix of couples| families| and age groups| although on both ocassions in the restaurants I was completely ignored and had to go and get myself a menu then go and ask a waiter to come and serve me. The room service menu had about 5 items on it| and they didnt serve after 7pm| which isn't particularly good - also the breakfast arrived 30 mins late both times it was ordered in the room. All in all a nice hotel| fabulous setting| but maybe need to improve staff service.,Glasgow,22-01-06,No,4
